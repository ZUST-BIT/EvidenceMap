        [
            "Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before.",
            "For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality.",
            "The results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular mortalities."

            "Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients."

It is not known whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential use of recommended therapies.",
            "Using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of therapy to short-term mortality.",
            "Admission to a top-ranked hospital was associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38)."

This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients.",
            "The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages.",
            "Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation."

In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other patients (4.2%, p<0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 0.067)."
