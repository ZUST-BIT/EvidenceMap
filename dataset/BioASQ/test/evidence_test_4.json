Patients who developed irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were prophylactically administered scopolamine butylbromide at the next scheduled treatment. Risk factors for irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were determined using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome occurred in 50.8% of patients.

            "Irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to severe neutropenia and delayed diarrhea, irinotecan causes cholinergic syndrome, characterized by abdominal pain and acute diarrhea. The latter symptoms are frequently observed during and after irinotecan treatment. Here, we have discussed the case of a patient who completely recovered from abdominal pain following the administration of loperamide hydrochloride (loperamide) at a dose of 2 mg, before infusing irinotecan. In contrast, anticholinergic drugs were not as effective in alleviating symptoms. A 28-year-old man with stage IV rectal cancer with peritoneal metastasis was prescribed with fluorouracil, irinotecan, and levofolinate calcium (FOLFIRI), in addition to cetuximab. Anticholinergic drugs, such as scopolamine butylbromide (scopolamine) or atropine sulfate (atropine), were administered to treat abdominal pain that was considered as irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome, but monotherapy was not effective. Thereafter, oral loperamide (2 mg) with atropine (0.25 mg) was prescribed before irinotecan infusion. Consequently, the patient did not experience any abdominal pain during and after irinotecan treatment. Loperamide is an opioid receptor agonist and decreases the activity of the myenteric plexus of the intestinal wall. It also inhibits the release of both acetylcholine and prostaglandins, resulting in decreased inhibition of peristaltic movement. We assumed that its mechanism solely or in combination contributed to symptom relief. We hypothesized that the synergistic anticholinergic interaction between loperamide and atropine resulted in marked suppression of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome compared to loperamide alone.",

            "Irinotecan (CPT-11) is an anticancer drug that occasionally produces acute cholinergic side effects. Preliminary findings suggest that these are mediated through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In this study, the inhibition of various AChEs by CPT-11 was studied. The lactone form of CPT-11 resulted in apparent noncompetitive inhibition of electric eel and both human recombinant and erythrocyte AChE with K(i) values of 0.065, 0.19, and 0.29 microM, respectively. The carboxylate form of CPT-11 was approximately 10 times less potent. Apparent noncompetitive inhibition of AChE may arise through several mechanisms, and those relevant to CPT-11 were identified from key experimental findings. First, the inhibition by CPT-11 was found to be instantly reversible in dilution studies. Second, incubation of the enzyme with CPT-11 before the introduction of neostigmine protected the enzyme from inactivation. Third, regeneration of the active enzyme after preincubation with neostigmine was totally suppressed by the addition of 2 microM CPT-11, indicating that CPT-11 is a potent inhibitor of decarbamoylation and, by inference, deacylation. Additional experiments with tacrine revealed functional differences between these two inhibitors. Also, preliminary molecular modeling of the interaction between AChE and CPT-11 indicated that the latter does not bind at the same site as tacrine. Displacement studies with the peripheral site-specific ligand, propidium, confirmed that CPT-11 binds at this site.",

Although intrinsic FAM134B protein expression in wild-type Neuro2a cells was affected by the supply of amino acids in the culture medium, the expression of each HSAN2B-linked mutant FAM134B protein was hardly affected by serum and amino acid deprivation. On the other hand, the intracellular localization of GFP-tagged HSAN2B-linked mutants, except for P7Gfs133X, overlapped well with ER-localized SP-RFPKDEL and did not differ from that of GFP-tagged wild-type FAM134B. However, analysis of protein‒protein interactions using the NanoBiT reporter assay revealed the difference between wild-type and C-terminal truncated mutant FAM134B. Furthermore, this NanoBiT assay demonstrated that both wild-type and G216R FAM134B interacted with LC3/GABARAPL1 to the same extent, but the FAM134B construct with mutations near the LC3-interacting region (LIR) did not. Similar to the NanoBiT assay, the C-terminal-truncated FAM134B showed lower ER-phagy activities, as assessed by the cotransfection of GFP-tagged reporters.CONCLUSIONS: We showed that wild-type and HSAN2B-linked FAM134B have different molecular characteristics by transfec",

Their relative expression shows extreme variation, both within normal tissues and among cancer types. Expression of full-length FAM134B is restricted to the brain, testis, spleen, and prostate. In contrast, NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B is dominant in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, and liver. We compared wild-type and knockout mice to study the role of the Fam134b gene in starvation. NH2 terminally truncated FAM134B-2 was induced in the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart but not in the pancreas and stomach following starvation.

In this study, we investigated the function of FAM134B in HCC and the related tumorigenesis mechanisms, as well as how FAM134B induces EMT. We detected the expression of FAM134B in a normal hepatic cell line, HCC cell lines, fresh specimens, and a HCC tissue microarray. A retrospective study of 122 paired HCC tissue microarrays was used to analyze the correlation between FAM134B and clinical features. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, rescue experiments, Akt pathway activator/inhibitors, nude mice xenograft models, and nude mice lung metastasis models were used to determine the underlying mechanisms of FAM134B in inducing tumorigenesis and EMT in vitro and in vivo. The expression level of FAM134B was highly elevated in HCC, as compared with that in normal liver tissues and normal hepatic cells. Overexpression of FAM134B was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.025), pathological vascular invasion (P = 0.026), differentiation grade (P = 0.023), cancer recurrence (P = 0.044), and portal vein tumor thrombus (P = 0.036) in HCC. Patients with high expression of FAM134B had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with non-high expression of FAM134B.

As part of a clinical trial comparing the utility of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) and optical colonoscopy (OC) for post colorectal cancer resection surveillance, we explored the diagnostic yield and costs of a strategy of CTC followed by OC if a polyp is observed (abbreviated CTC_S), versus OC 1 year following curative bowel resection, using the detection of actionable polyps on OC as the criterion. Methods. Using data from 231 patients who underwent same-day CTC followed by OC, we created a decision tree that outlined the choices and outcomes at 1-year clinical follow-up. Colorectal polyp prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of CTC were compared with five exemplary studies and meta-analyses. Detection criteria were derived for ≥6 mm or ≥10 mm polyps. OC was the gold standard. Costs were gleaned from cataloging components of the cases at the principal investigator's institution. Analyses included marginal cost of the OC strategy to detect additional actionable polyps and number of polyps missed per 10,000 patients. Results. At our prevalence of 0.156 for ≥6 mm (0.043 ≥10 mm), CTC_S would miss 779 ≥6 mm actionable polyps per 10,000 patients (≥10 mm: 173 per 10,000). Cost to detect an additional ≥6 mm polyp in this cohort is $5,700 (≥10 mm: $28,000). Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that any improvement in performance characteristics would raise the cost of OC to detect more actionable polyps.

The most common forms of CV are associated with chronic infections (especially hepatitis C), autoimmune diseases, and certain malignancies. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Vessel Size Specificity**: CV mainly impacts small to medium-sized blood vessels, leading to manifestations such as purpura, renal injury, and neuropathy, rather than involving larger vessels.\n\n2. **Clinical Features**: Symptoms often include skin lesions (such as palpable purpura), arthralgia, and systemic symptoms due to the organ effects of inflammation in these smaller vessels.\n\n3. **Diagnosis and Histopathology**: The diagnosis typically involves serological tests for cryoglobulins, along with skin or kidney biopsies where small vessel inflammation is noted.\n\nIn summary, while CV is a serious condition affecting multiple systems, it does not primarily involve large blood vessels, distinguishing it from other systemic vasculitides like giant cell arteritis or polyarteritis nodosa.",

Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemic nephropathy who have a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis should receive immunosuppressive therapy. After disease stabilization, patients should receive concurrent therapy for the underlying HCV infection. The standard therapy of a chronic HCV infection is IFN monotherapy or IFN combined with ribavirin; however, after the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), the standard therapy for patients with HCV genotype 1 has dramatically changed. We report a case of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) successfully treated by daclatasvir and asunaprevir, which are IFN-free DAAs for HCV, in combination with angiotensin II receptor blocker without immunosuppressive therapy. The patient developed severe nephrotic syndrome with progressive kidney dysfunction.

Its persistent activation is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatments, including targeted therapies.\n\n3. **HIF-1α (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha)**: In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment of gliomas, HIF-1α is upregulated, promoting angiogenesis and metabolic adaptation. This adaptation not only facilitates tumor growth but also contributes to resistance against therapies by enabling tumor cells to survive under low oxygen conditions.\n\n4. **OCT4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4)**: Often associated with stem cell properties, OCT4 is linked to glioma stem cells, which are thought to play a crucial role in tumor initiation and recurrence. Its expression is associated with therapy resistance and the ability to sustain tumor growth post-treatment.\n\n5. **SOX2 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 2)**: Similar to OCT4, SOX2 is implicated in maintaining stemness in gliomas. Its expression correlates with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor therapeutic responses, as it supports the self-renewal and multipotent characteristics of glioma stem cells.\n\nThese transcription factors are intertwined in pathways that promote glioma progression and enable tumor cells to resist various therapeutic modalities, making them important targets for research and potential therapeutic intervention.",

Pooled analysis of cardiovascular adverse events was developed by relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with software STATA 13.0 and RevMan 5.3.RESULTS: Thirty studies including 3813 patients were fit into analysis. The incidences of cardiovascular events of all-grade were: hypertension, 36.8% (95% CI, 29.8%-43.8%), hemorrhage, 8.6% (95% CI, 3.2%-14%), thrombosis, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-2.8%), and heart failure, 2.9% (95% CI, 0.3%-5.6%).

            "fe setting.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with mCRC were prospectively registered and initially received ≤160 mg oral regorafenib daily, at the investigator's discretion, for weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle. The study's primary aim was to assess safety, particularly unexpected clinically significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A Cox's proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between OS, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), and baseline characteristics.RESULTS: We evaluated 1,227 of 1,301 patients (enrolled from March 2013 to May 2015). ADRs occurred in 89.3% of patients (mostly within the first 4 weeks) and were a major reason for discontinuing treatment. The most frequent ADRs were HFSR, liver injury, and hypertension. The cumulative incidence of HFSR and liver injury was higher in patients who initially received 160 mg than in those who received ≤120 mg. The incidence of hypertension and fatigue was similar between groups. Median OS was 6.9 months (95% confidential interval, 6.4-7.4). OS was associated with early onset of HFSR and good performance status (PS) but not with the initial dose.CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study were consistent with those of clinical trials. There were no new safety concerns. Regorafenib treatment would not be recommended for patients with higher PS.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Previous clinical trials demonstrated regorafenib improved overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progress after standard chemotherapies. Because the eligibility criteria of the trials were restricted compared with a real-world setting, the data from the trials may not fully represent the profiles of regorafenib in clinical practice.

Patients with asthma were also divided into eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic phenotypes. A pulmonary function test was performed in all the participants,and serum and induced sputum TARC, periostin concentrations, eosinophils, and total immunoglobulin E valueswere examined.RESULTS: TARC and periostin levels were significantly higher in the asthma group than in the control group (p < 0.001). The serum TARC level in the eosinophilic group was significantly higher than in the non-eosinophilic and control groups(p < 0.001). The induced sputum TARC level was significantly higher in the non-eosinophilic group than in the control group(p < 0.001).

            "OBJECTIVE: Periostin, a matricellular protein, is produced from airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts by IL-13. It has been suggested that periostin is involved in allergic inflammation and fibrosis. However, the usefulness of serum periostin measurement in the assessment of airway inflammation and remodeling and management of asthmatic patients is still debated. We aimed to determine whether serum periostin levels reflect eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway remodeling in asthma.METHODS: We examined the relationship of serum periostin levels with clinical features, biomarkers for eosinophilic airway inflammation, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and blood eosinophil counts, and pulmonary functions in 235 well-controlled asthmatic patients on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) treatment.RESULTS: Serum periostin levels were positively correlated with blood eosinophil counts (%) and age (r = 0.36 and 0.23, respectively), and were negatively correlated with body weight and FEV1/FVC (%) (r = -0.24 and - 0.23, respectively) in well-controlled asthmatic patients on ICS treatment (daily dose of 453 µg equivalent to fluticasone propionate). Blood eosinophil counts and serum periostin levels were similarly associated with increased FeNO levels (≥40 ppb) in the asthmatics. Serum periostin levels were better associated with fixed airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC ratio <70%) than FeNO levels, blood eosinophil counts or total IgE levels in the asthmatics.

Serum and IS levels of periostin, TSLP, IL-4, and IL-13 were determined in 12 atopic asthmatics, 16 COPD sufferers, and 10 controls. We noticed a significantly higher IS periostin and TSLP concentration at protein and mRNA level in asthmatics compared to the two other groups; additionally, periostin and TSLP were correlated positively with IS eosinophil count. A strong positive correlation between IS periostin and TSLP protein levels (r = 0.96) as well as mRNA expression level (r = 0.95) was found in patients with asthma.

            "BACKGROUND: Periostin has been shown to be a marker of Type 2 airway inflammation, associated with airway eosinophilia. It has a potential role in identifying asthmatics who may be responsive to treatment with monoclonal antibody therapy directed against Type 2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 receptor subunit-α and immunoglobulin E. The clinical utility of periostin measurements depends on better understanding of factors that may affect serum periostin levels, such as race. We aimed to identify the ranges of serum periostin in Chinese adults both with and without asthma, and compare them with those previously identified in Caucasian adults.METHODS: A two-centred cross-sectional study, recruiting 188 Chinese adults, aged 18 to 75 years. 120 participants had no history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 68 participants had a doctor's diagnosis of asthma and were on current treatment. Univariate comparisons of periostin by dichotomous variables were made using t-tests with logarithmic transformation as the distribution of periostin was skewed.RESULTS: In the Chinese non-asthma group, periostin levels were sex-, but not age-dependent, with females having higher periostin levels. The individual predicted (90% CI) reference range for periostin in females was 61.1 ng/ml (41.6 to 89.8) ng/ml and in males was 53.2 ng/ml (36.1 to 78.3) ng/ml. There was no difference in median serum periostin levels between Chinese non-asthmatics and Chinese asthmatics, 57.0 versus 56.8 ng/ml, difference (95% CI) 0.1 (- 4.2 to 4.2) ng/ml, P = 0.94.

            "The involvement of periostin in Th2-dependent allergic inflammation has been documented. However, the significance of periostin as a biomarker of local allergic inflammation in the nasal mucosa (NM) of patients with atopic bronchial asthma (BA) and allergic rhinitis (AR) is yet to be determined. The aim of the study was to determine the presence of periostin and evaluate its role as a non-invasive marker of allergic inflammation in the nasal secretions of children with atopic BA and AR.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 43 patients aged 4-17 years with atopic BA and AR, the NM was examined using nasal video-endoscopy and (if indicated) computed tomography; the amount of periostin in the nasal secretion was determined by the enzyme immunoassay.RESULTS: Exacerbation of AR was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in the level of periostin in the nasal secretion: up to 0.84 [0.06; 48.79] ng/mg, whereas in remission, that was 0.13 [0.00; 0.36] ng/mg; p=0.04. This value increased progressively as the severity of AR increased from 0.16 [0.00; 0.36] ng/mg in the mild course to 0.20 [0.00; 9.03] ng/mg in AR of moderate severity, and to 10.70 [0.56; 769.20] ng/mg in most severe cases; p=0.048. Hypertrophy or polyposis of the nasal and/or paranasal mucosa was detected in 34.9% (15/43) of the examined patients.

However, the role of periostin in arsenic-related asthma is unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the associations of serum periostin levels with arsenic exposure and the features of asthma in 442 individuals in Bangladesh who participated in our previous study. Exposure levels of the participants were determined by measuring the arsenic concentrations in drinking water, hair, and nails through inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Periostin levels in serum were assessed by immunoassay. In this study, we found that serum periostin levels of the participants were increased with increasing exposure to arsenic. Notably, even the participants with 10.1-50 μg/L arsenic in drinking water had significantly higher levels of periostin than participants with <10 μg/L of water arsenic. Elevated serum periostin levels were positively associated with serum levels of Th2 mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and eotaxin. Each log increase in periostin levels was associated with approximately eight- and three-fold increases in the odds ratios (ORs) for reversible airway obstruction (RAO) and asthma symptoms, respectively. Additionally, causal mediation analyses revealed that arsenic exposure metrics had both direct and indirect (periostin-mediated) effects on the risk of RAO and asthma symptoms.",

After we found that periostin is a downstream molecule of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, signature cytokines of type 2 immune responses, we showed that periostin is a component of subepithelial fibrosis in bronchial asthma, the first formal proof that periostin is involved in allergic inflammation.

Although periostin is mainly produced in airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts after interleukin (IL)-13 stimulation, whether BSM cells produce periostin remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated periostin production in BSM cells and the mechanisms involved.METHODS: Human BSM cells were cultured, and the effect of IL-13 stimulation on periostin production was evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We evaluated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6 (STAT6), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and Akt after IL-13 stimulation. Furthermore, using ELISA, we evaluated the influence of several phosphorylation inhibitors on periostin production.RESULTS: Periostin mRNA expression increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner after IL-13 stimulation; periostin production was induced 24 and 48 h after stimulation. IL-13 stimulation induced the phosphorylation of STAT6, ERK1/2, and Akt. IL-13-induced periostin production was attenuated by inhibiting STAT6 phosphorylation and strongly suppressed by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 phosphorylation or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: BSM cells produced periostin after IL-13 stimulation, via the J",

The most commonly affected are:\n\n1. **TP53**: Mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, are prevalent in glioblastomas. p53 is crucial for regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis, and its dysfunction can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation.\n\n2. **NF1**: The neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (NF1) is often mutated or deleted in glioblastoma. NF1 encodes a protein that negatively regulates the RAS pathway, and loss of NF1 function can result in enhanced cell growth and survival.\n\n3. **PTEN**: The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene is another critical tumor suppressor affected in glioblastoma. PTEN normally inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and its loss leads to increased cell metabolism, survival, and growth.\n\n4. **CDKN2A**: Deletions or mutations in the CDKN2A gene, which encodes p16INK4a, are common in glioblastoma. This protein is involved in cell cycle regulation, and its loss removes a critical checkpoint, allowing for unchecked cellular division.\n\nThese genetic alterations contribute significantly to glioblastoma's aggressive nature, promoting tumor growth, survival, and resistance to treatment.",

First discovered as an essential component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA splicing machinery, Tpt1 is widely distributed in nature, including in taxa that have no yeast-like RNA splicing system. Here we characterize the RslTpt1 protein from the bacterium Runella slithyformis, in which Tpt1 is encoded within a putative RNA repair gene cluster. We find that (i) expression of RslTpt1 in yeast complements a lethal tpt1Δ knockout, and (ii) purified recombinant RslTpt1 is a bona fide NAD+-dependent 2'-phosphotransferase capable of completely removing an internal 2'-phosphate from synthetic RNAs. The in vivo activity of RslTpt1 is abolished by alanine substitutions for conserved amino acids Arg16, His17, Arg64, and Arg119.

The R16A mutant is 300-fold slower than wild-type RslTpt1 in forming the 2'-P-ADPR intermediate. Whereas wild-type RsTpt1 rapidly converts the isolated 2'-P-ADPR intermediate to 2'-OH product in the absence of NAD+, the H17A, R119A, R64A, and R16A mutant are slower by factors of 3, 33, 210, and 710, respectively.",

While the mechanism of nucleotide selection and polymerization is well understood, it remains a mystery why bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes exhibit an unexpected and surprisingly low tRNA substrate affinity while they efficiently catalyze the CCA-addition. To get insights into the evolution of this high-fidelity RNA synthesis, the reconstruction and characterization of ancestral enzymes is a versatile tool. Here, we investigate a reconstructed candidate of a 2 billion years old CCA-adding enzyme from Gammaproteobacteria and compare it to the corresponding modern enzyme of Escherichia coli. We show that the ancestral candidate catalyzes an error-free CCA-addition, but has a much higher tRNA affinity compared with the extant enzyme. The consequence of this increased substrate binding is an enhanced reverse reaction, where the enzyme removes the CCA end from the mature tRNA. As a result, the ancestral candidate exhibits a lower catalytic efficiency in vitro as well as in vivo.",

Other clinical features found in children include sensorineural deafness, cerebellar atrophy, brittle hair, partial villous atrophy and nephrocalcinosis.

CRC is characterised by significant dysbiosis including reduced short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. Recent findings suggest that exercise can modify the gut microbiota, and these changes are inverse to the changes seen with CRC; however, this exercise-microbiota interaction is currently understudied in CRC.

Indeed, the metabolism of 14C-7K delivered in CMR mirrored that of acLDL and was much more rapid than (3)H-cholesterol delivered simultaneously. The 7K-derived (14)C was cleared from the liver, appeared in the intestine and was excreted in the faeces. A substantial proportion of the 7K-derived (14)C in the intestine and faeces was aqueous-soluble, indicating metabolism to polar products, presumably bile acids. Moreover, while cholesterol-derived (3)H increased in the aorta, (14)C appeared transiently and there was no observable accumulation within 24 h.

Some centres are now performing 'no-stoma' transplants, with preliminary data showing no adverse effects from this strategy and other surgical advances have lessened the physiological insult of the transplant operation.

            "Intestinal transplantation is now possible and in some conditions, constitutes the logical treatment option. Since 1985, more than 300 small-bowel grafts have been performed, involving the isolated small bowel with or without the colon (45%), the liver + small bowel (40%) or several organs (15%). 2/3 of recipients were under 20 years of age, and indications were short-bowel syndrome (64%), severe intractable diarrhea (13%), abdominal cancer (13%), or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome (8%). 51% of patients survived > 2 years after the graft. Patient and graft survival depends on the type of immunosuppression, i.e. Cyclosporine or FK 506. The results must be interpreted carefully as they represent the first experience in numerous centers using different immuno-suppressive protocols, without any randomization. The results from the largest of these centers more closely reflect the current situation and may exceed a 70% 2-year survival rate. Functional grafts lead to gastrointestinal autonomy (weaning of PN) while maintaining satisfactory nutritional status and normal growth in childhood. Intestinal transplantation is theoretically indicated for all patients permanently or persistently dependent on PN. However, as PN is generally well tolerated, even for long periods, each indication for transplantation must be carefully weighed up in terms of the iatrogenic risk and quality of life.

Although MG is not highly prevalent, there are up to 60,000 individuals with MG in the US, making it a disease that many pharmacists will likely encounter at least once in their career. Immunosuppressant medications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstays of treatment, although there is limited evidence as to which agents are most efficacious.

It was recently shown that alternative splicing underlies the formation of circular RNAs (circRNA) arising from the Titin (TTN) gene. Since the main mechanism by which circRNAs are formed is still unclear, we hypothesized that alternative splicing, and in particular exon skipping, is a major driver of circRNA production. We performed RNA sequencing on human and mouse hearts, mapped alternative splicing events, and overlaid these with expressed circRNAs at exon-level resolution. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing on hearts of Rbm20 KO mice to address how important Rbm20-mediated alternative splicing is in the production of cardiac circRNAs. In human and mouse hearts, we show that cardiac circRNAs are mostly (∼90%) produced from constitutive exons and less (∼10%) from alternatively spliced exons. In Rbm20 KO hearts, we identified 38 differentially expressed circRNAs of which 12 were produced from the Ttn gene. Even though Ttn appeared the most prominent target of Rbm20 for circularization, we also detected Rbm20-dependent circRNAs arising from other genes including Fan1, Stk39, Xdh, Bcl2l13, and Sorbs1 Interestingly, only Ttn circRNAs seemed to arise from Rbm20-mediated skipped exons.",

There is a need to refine prognostic information to more accurately predict survival as patients survive for any given length of time to assist multidisciplinary cancer management teams in treatment decisions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single center retrospective analysis of patients treated with metastatic CRC (unresectable and resectable) who survived >24 months between 2005 and 2015 (N=155). Patient tumor and treatment related variables were collected. Overall survival (OS) estimates conditional on surviving >24 months were compared with actuarial survival estimates of a cohort of patients (33,104 resected, 39,382 unresected) from the National Cancer Database (NCDB).RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 44.2 months, the median OS of resected patients (n=86) was not reached.

Patients were categorized as colon and rectum according to the tumor's location. Survival was identified as the primary outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests in survival assessment were used.RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-one patients with a mean age of 62.8 ± 12.7 years were included in the study.

            "Introduction Survival of patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has increased over the last decades. These benefits appear to be restricted to patients aged 50 and above. However, among the population aged < 50, CRC incidence and mortality rates are significantly rising. The clinical benefit of treatment in this population still is a matter of debate. We aim to compare the clinical outcome between patients aged 50 and younger. Methods In this retrospective, observational study, we analyzed data from 1077 patients treated for mCRC at three cancer centers in Austria from January 2005 to December 2019. Patients were divided into two groups based on age at diagnosis: <50 years (eo-CRC) and >50 years (regular-onset CRC, ro-CRC). Propensity score matching was used to control for potential biases, and survival outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results The differences in tumor characteristics between eo-CRC and ro-CRC in the overall population were primarily related to tumor sidedness and disease-free survival following intended curative resection. Our data show that eo-CRC patients underwent metastases resection more often and received significantly more lines of treatment in the palliative setting.",

Three-hundred and seventy-nine patients (median age 60 years, range 30-87 years) were enrolled from April 1993 to March 2000. Median follow-up was 6 years (range 3-10 years), until July 2003. All patients were evaluable for survival and 342 were evaluable for response and toxicity. Thirty-seven patients did not undergo chemotherapy. All patients had confirmed histology as well as metastatic disease based on radiological tests. First-line treatment was administered to 342 patients: leucovorin (LV) 30 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 425 mg/m2. Three different combinations were given as second-line treatment during different chronological periods: i) 5-FU, mitomycin-C and doxorubicin (FAM); ii) 5-FU and cisplatin (CDDP) and iii) 5-FU, LV and irinotecan (CPT-II). Responses were observed as follows: first-line treatment 16.37%, after FAM 25%, following 5-FU-CDDP 26.83% and after 5-FU-LV-CPT-II, 30.61%. Survival of all patients was as follows: median 25 months (range 16.1-33.9 months). The longest survival was of patients on 5-FU-LV-CPT-II. Median survival of patients with stable disease was 19 months and of untreated patients 12 months.",
            "The last ten years allowed a rapid evolution for colon chemotherapy with a switch from 5-FU modulated by leucovorin to poly-chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidines with oxaliplatin or irinotecan) integrated into therapeutic strategies, where surgery had a place more and more important in metastatic patients. In correlation with these advances, median survival of patient with metastatic colorectal cancer is between 17 and 22 months. Targeted therapeutics with monoclonal antibody such as EGF inhibitors (cetuximab) or VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab) had for the first time demonstrated efficacy with encouraging results in randomised trials. In adjuvant situation, LV5FU2 is less toxic than monthly FUFOL and no statistically significant difference could be detected in disease-free or overall survival between the two schedules. Oxaliplatin combined with 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) is the first combination to demonstrate significant superiority over 5 fluorouracil and leucovorin in adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy benefited to patients with stage II or III colon cancer with microsatellite-stable tumours or tumour exhibiting low-frequency microsatellite instability but may be not those with tumours exhibiting high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI). These data need to be confirmed by prospective studies before changing our therapeutic references.",
            "PURPOSE: The advantage of chemotherapy in asymptomatic patients with advanced colorectal cancer is debatable. Whether early chemotherapy improves survival and the length of the symptom-free period versus no therapy until symptoms appear was studied in a randomized trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 183 patients with advanced, but asymptomatic colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to receive either initial treatment with sequential methotrexate 250 mg/m2 during the first 2 hours, and fluorouracil (5-FU) 500 mg/m2 at hours 3 and 23 followed by leucovorin rescue initiated at hour 24 (MFL) for 12 courses or to primary expectancy with chemotherapy not considered until symptoms appeared. One patient was ineligible and excluded from analysis. Nine patients did not fulfill the inclusion criteria and five patients refused treatment allocation; these patients were not excluded from the study population so as not to introduce bias. So far, 51 of 90 (60%) patients in the expectancy group have received chemotherapy.RESULTS: Overall survival was better in the MFL group than in the expectancy group (Breslow-Gehan, P less than .02; log-rank, P = .13) with a difference in median survival of approximately 5 months. Also the symptom-free period and the time to disease progression were longer in the MFL group (P less than .001), with median differences of 8 and 4 months, respectively.

Here we elucidate the interactions between various proteins involved in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). An in vitro mTORC1 kinase assay approach was used to probe the role of the mTORC1 component Raptor and revealed that certain Raptor mutations disrupt binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and prevent its subsequent phosphorylation by mTOR. Interestingly, we show that a point mutation in the highly conserved Raptor RNC domain still allows binding to mTOR but prevents Raptor association and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, indicating that this Raptor domain facilitates substrate recognition by mTORC1. This Raptor RNC domain mutant also dominantly inhibits mTORC1 signalling to 4E-BP1, S6K1 and HIF1alpha in vivo. We further characterise the functions of the mTORC1 signalling (TOS) and RAIP motifs of 4E-BP1, which are involved in substrate recognition by Raptor and phosphorylation by mTORC1. We show that an mTOR mutant, L1460P, responds to insulin even in nutrient-deprived conditions and is resistant to inhibition by inactive RagB-RagC heterodimers that mimic nutrient withdrawal suggesting that this region of mTOR is involved in sensing the permissive amino acid input. We found that FKBP38 inhibits mTOR(L1460P), while the mTOR(E2419K) kinase domain mutant was resistant to FKBP38 inhibition. Finally, we show that activation of mTORC1 by both Rheb and RhebL1 is impaired by FKBP38.

While diverse stimuli regulate mTORC1 signaling, the direct molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 senses and responds to these signals remain poorly defined. Here we investigated the role of mTOR phosphorylation in mTORC1 function. By employing mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we demonstrated novel phosphorylation on S2159 and T2164 within the mTOR kinase domain. Mutational analysis of these phosphorylation sites indicates that dual S2159/T2164 phosphorylation cooperatively promotes mTORC1 signaling to S6K1 and 4EBP1. Mechanistically, S2159/T2164 phosphorylation modulates the mTOR-raptor and raptor-PRAS40 interactions and augments mTORC1-associated mTOR S2481 autophosphorylation. Moreover, mTOR S2159/T2164 phosphorylation promotes cell growth and cell cycle progression.",
            "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase originally discovered as the molecular target of the immunosuppressant rapamycin. mTOR forms two compositionally and functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are crucial for coordinating nutrient, energy, oxygen, and growth factor availability with cellular growth, proliferation, and survival.

            "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase functions in two multiprotein complexes: lysosomal mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 at the plasma membrane. mTORC1 modulates the cell response to growth factors and nutrients by increasing protein synthesis and cell growth, and repressing the autophagy-lysosomal pathway1-4; however, dysfunction in mTORC1 is implicated in various diseases3,5,6. mTORC1 activity is regulated by phosphoinositide lipids7-10. Class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate6,11 at the plasma membrane stimulates mTORC1 signalling, while local synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate by starvation-induced recruitment of class II PI3K-β (PI3KC2-β) to lysosomes represses mTORC1 activity12. How the localization and activity of PI3KC2-β are regulated by mitogens is unknown. We demonstrate that protein kinase N (PKN) facilitates mTORC1 signalling by repressing PI3KC2-β-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate synthesis downstream of mTORC2. Active PKN2 phosphorylates PI3KC2-β to trigger PI3KC2-β complex formation with inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins. Conversely, loss of PKN2 or inactivation of its target phosphorylation site in PI3KC2-β represses nutrient signalling via mTORC1.",
            "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal signals. These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin. Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1.",
            "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a component of two large complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which play crucial roles in regulating cell growth and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell proliferation remain elusive. Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314, which resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), the kinase responsible for Ser314 phosphorylation. Expression of FoxO3a mutated at Ser314 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing CDKI expression. SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation.",

They include questions about the actual mechanisms by which mTORC1 signaling is stimulated by hormones and growth factors, which involves the small GTPase Rheb, and by amino acids, which involves other GTPase proteins. The control of Rheb and the mechanism by which it activates mTORC1 remain incompletely understood. Although it has been known for many years that rapamycin interferes with some functions of mTORC1, it is not known how it does this, or why only some functions of mTORC1 are affected.",
            "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions in two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor.",

Interestingly, mTORC1 negatively regulates Akt activation, but whether mTORC1 signaling directly targets mTORC2 remains unknown. Here we show that growth factors promote the phosphorylation of Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), an essential subunit of mTORC2. We found that Rictor phosphorylation requires mTORC1 activity and, more specifically, the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). We identified several phosphorylation sites in Rictor and found that Thr1135 is directly phosphorylated by S6K1 in vitro and in vivo, in a rapamycin-sensitive manner.

            "INTRODUCTION: Insulin icodec is a novel, long-acting insulin analog designed to cover basal insulin requirements with once-weekly subcutaneous administration. Here we describe the molecular engineering and the biological and pharmacological properties of insulin icodec.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A number of in vitro assays measuring receptor binding, intracellular signaling as well as cellular metabolic and mitogenic responses were used to characterize the biological properties of insulin icodec. To evaluate the pharmacological properties of insulin icodec in individuals with type 2 diabetes, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multiple-dose, dose escalation trial was conducted.RESULTS: The long half-life of insulin icodec was achieved by introducing modifications to the insulin molecule aiming to obtain a safe, albumin-bound circulating depot of insulin icodec, providing protracted insulin action and clearance. Addition of a C20 fatty diacid-containing side chain imparts strong, reversible albumin binding, while three amino acid substitutions (A14E, B16H and B25H) provide molecular stability and contribute to attenuating insulin receptor (IR) bindin",

            "AIMS: To characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of once-weekly insulin icodec in type 2 diabetes (T2D).MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an open-label trial, 46 individuals with T2D (18-75 years; body mass index 18.0-38.0 kg/m2 ; glycated haemoglobin ≤75 mmol/mol [≤9%]; basal insulin-treated) received subcutaneous once-weekly icodec for ≥8 weeks at individualized doses, aiming at a pre-breakfast plasma glucose concentration of 4.4 to 7.0 mmol/L (80-126 mg/dL) on the last three mornings of each weekly dosing interval. Frequent blood sampling to assess total serum icodec concentration (ie, albumin-bound and unbound) occurred from first icodec dose until 35 days after last dose. Icodec trough concentrations following initiation of once-weekly dosing were predicted by pharmacokinetic modelling. During the final 3 weeks of icodec treatment, while at steady state, the icodec glucose-lowering effect was assessed in three glucose clamps (target 7.5 mmol/L [135 mg/dL]): 0 to 36, 40 to 64 and 144 to 168 h post-dose, thus covering the initial, middle and last part of the 1-week dosing interval. Glucose-lowering effect during a complete dosing interval was predicted by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling.RESULTS: Model-predicted icodec steady state was attained after 3 to 4 weeks. At steady state, model-predicted daily proportions of glucose-lowering effect on days 1 to 7 of the 1-week dosing interval were 14.1%, 16.1%, 15.8%, 15.0%, 14.0%, 13.0% and 12.0%, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic blood sampling occurred frequently until 35 days post-dose. Partial glucose-lowering effect was assessed 36-60 h post-dose in a glucose clamp (target 7.5 mmol/L). Steady-state pharmacokinetics following multiple once-weekly dosing were simulated using a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model.RESULTS: Total icodec exposure (area under the curve from zero to infinity after single dose; AUC0-∞,SD) was similar between injection in the thigh, abdomen and upper arm (estimated AUC0-∞,SD ratios [95% confidence interval]: abdomen/thigh 1.02 [0.96-1.09], p = 0.473; upper arm/thigh 1.04 [0.98-1.10], p = 0.162; abdomen/upper arm 0.98 [0.93-1.05], p = 0.610).

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Clinical Efficacy**: Studies indicate that FOLFIRI plus Aflibercept improves progression-free survival and overall survival compared to FOLFIRI alone. This therapeutic benefit can justify higher costs associated with the addition of Aflibercept.\n\n2. **Economic Evaluations**: Health economic analyses often employ models to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatments for CRC. These studies typically show that while the upfront costs for FOLFIRI plus Aflibercept are higher, the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) can make the therapy cost-effective depending on the willingness-to-pay threshold set by healthcare systems.\n\n3. **Budget Impact**: The treatment's cost-effectiveness varies by healthcare system and reimbursement policies. In some analyses, the high costs associated with Aflibercept may be a concern for budget-constrained healthcare settings. However, it may still be seen as cost-effective when considering the potential for reduced downstream costs (e.g., decreased hospitalization due to better disease control).\n\n4. **Sensitivity Analyses**: Multiple studies incorporate sensitivity analyses to evaluate how variations in drug prices, treatment adherence, and patient response impact cost-effectiveness, suggesting that under various scenarios, FOLFIRI plus Aflibercept remains a viable option in certain patient populations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the treatment is associated with higher costs, its clinical efficacy and the potential for enhancing patient outcomes can lead to a conclusion of cost-effectiveness in advanced colorectal cancer settings, particularly tailored to specific patient characteristics and healthcare contexts.",

Although these combination regimens are recommended among the standard therapies, significant additional cost is a concern. The comparative cost-effectiveness of AFL and RAM was examined from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer.METHODS: A partitioned survival analysis was constructed. The data sources were the VELOUR (Aflibercept Versus Placebo in Combination With Irinotecan and 5-FU in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer After Failure of an Oxaliplatin Based Regimen) and RAISE (Ramucirumab Versus Placebo in Combination With Second-Line FOLFIRI in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma That Progressed During or After First-Line Therapy With Bevacizumab, Oxaliplatin, and a Fluoropyrimidine) trials, which compared FOLFIRI alone with AFL or RAM in second-line treatment for mCRC.

            "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of aflibercept (Sanofi) to submit clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence for aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy [irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI)] for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer which has progressed following prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, as part of the Institute's Single Technology Appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA307 issued in March 2014. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The clinical effectiveness data were derived from one good-quality double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), the VELOUR trial, which compared aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with placebo plus FOLFIRI. This RCT found a small but statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS); the difference in median OS was 1.44 months (13.5 months in the aflibercept group and 12.06 months in the placebo group). There was also a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) with aflibercept; the difference in median PFS was 2.23 months (6.9 months in the aflibercept group and 4.67 months in the placebo group). However, grade 3-4 adverse events were more frequent in the aflibercept group than the placebo group: 83.5% compared with 62.5%. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of patients in the aflibercept group and 12.1% of patients in the placebo group. The manufacturer's submission included an estimation of mean OS benefit based on extrapolation of the data, which was considerably longer than the median OS benefit reported (4.7 vs. 1.44 months). The ERG considered this to be an over estimate. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the overall population was reported by the manufacturer to be £36,294 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). After correcting the model programming and updating the model to include the ERG's preferred parameter estimates, the ICER from the ERG's alternative base case was £54,368 per QALY. The extrapolation of the OS curves was the key cost-effectiveness driver and a major source of uncertainty in the model. Additional scenarios related to the extrapolation of OS undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs between £62,894 and £92,089 per QALY. After consideration of the manufacturer's submission and the ERG's critique, and submissions from other stakeholders, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy could not be considered a cost effective use of National Health Service resources for treating metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen.",

The efficacy was assessed using changes in symptoms, visual analogue scale, and changes in magnetic resonance imaging. Results Overall, 54 patients (35.2% male) were included with bone marrow edema syndrome, with a mean age of 52.7 ± 9.77 years (range: 35 - 74 years). The most commonly affected joint was the knee in 32 patients (59.2%), followed by the foot/ankle in 13 patients (24.1%), and the hip in nine patients (16.7%). Improved mobility was reported by 29 patients (53.7%) among the total number of the patients at the six-month follow-up visit.

Key components of the TME, including immune cells, blood vessels, extracellular matrix, and signaling molecules, create a supportive niche for tumor growth and survival. \n\nCancer stem cells (CSCs), a subset of cells within the glioblastoma, are particularly implicated in recurrence due to their abilities to self-renew and differentiate into more tumor cells. CSCs can evade conventional therapies, leading to tumor regrowth after initial treatment. The TME contributes to CSC maintenance and proliferation through various mechanisms, such as promoting immunosuppressive signals and providing survival factors that enhance CSC properties.\n\nMoreover, the intercellular communication within the TME, including exosomes and cytokine signaling, further supports glioblastoma's resilience against therapeutic interventions. This complex interaction between the TME and CSCs creates significant hurdles in achieving durable responses to treatment, ultimately leading to glioblastoma recurrence.

        "llm_evidence": "Bacteroides fragilis, a prominent member of the gut microbiota, has been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) through several molecular mechanisms. One key finding is the production of a specific enterotoxin known as Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT), which can induce pro-inflammatory responses and alter cellular signaling pathways. BFT promotes the overexpression of cytokines such as IL-17 and TNF-α, leading to chronic inflammation, a well-known risk factor for CRC.\n\nFurthermore, B. fragilis can disrupt the mucosal barrier and promote the translocation of bacteria and their products into the gut tissue, exacerbating inflammation. It can also influence the host immune response by modulating T cell populations, contributing to a shift towards a more inflammatory environment that favors tumorigenesis.\n\nAdditionally, B. fragilis is involved in the metabolism of dietary components, affecting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which play a role in maintaining gut homeostasis. An imbalance in SCFA production can disrupt epithelial integrity and promote malignant transformation.\n\nIn summary, Bacteroides fragilis is associated with colorectal cancer development through the production of inflammatory toxins, disruption of gut mucosal barriers, and alterations in immune responses and gut metabolism, culminating in a pro-carcinogenic environment.",

CRC patients present with an increase in pathogens in their gut microbiota, such as polyketide synthase-positive bacteria (pks +) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). The pks + Escherichia coli promotes carcinogenesis and facilitates CRC progression through the production of colibactin, a genotoxin that induces double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). ETBF is a procarcinogenic bacterium producing the B. fragilis toxin (bft) that promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by modulating the mucosal immune response and inducing epithelial cell changes.METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy controls (N = 62) and CRC patients (N = 94) from the province of Québec (Canada), and a bacterial DNA extraction was performed. Fecal DNA samples were then examined for the presence of the pks island gene and bft using conventional qualitative PCR.RESULTS: We found that a high proportion of healthy controls are colonized by pks + bacteria (42%) and that these levels were similar in CRC patients (46%). bft was detected in 21% of healthy controls and 32% of CRC patients, while double colonization by both pks + bacteria and ETBF occurred in 8% of the healthy controls and 13% of the CRC patients.

On the contrary, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), a subtype of B. fragilis, produces an enterotoxin (BFT; B. fragilis toxin), leading to asymptomatic chronic infections and colonic tumor formation. However, the impact of B. fragilis and ETBF on the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. We aim to assess whether their presence affects the outcome in patients with CRC after curative resection.METHODS: We obtained 197 pairs of matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues of patients with pathological stage (pstage) II and III CRC after curative resection. The presence of B. fragilis and ETBF were estimated using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients were analyzed.RESULTS: 16 S rRNA for B. fragilis and bft DNA were detected in 120 (60.9%) and 12 (6.1%) of the 197 patients, respectively. B. fragilis-positive patients had better RFS than B. fragilis-negative patients, although that was not statistically significant. In subgroup analysis, better outcomes on RFS were observed in the presence of B. fragilis in pstage II and left-sided CRC. The association of B. fragilis positivity on OS was accentuated in the depth of T4 subgroup. No significant differences were observed in RFS and OS between ETBF and non-toxigenic B. fragilis.CONCLUSIONS: Ou",

They contribute to influence variety of biological mechanisms including inflammation, cell signaling, cell-cycle disruption which are majorly disrupted in carcinogenic activities.PURPOSE: In this review, we intend to discuss recent updates and possible molecular mechanisms to provide the role of bacterial metabolites, gut bacteria and diet in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Recent evidences have proposed the role of bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleaturm, Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium septicum, in the carcinogenesis of CRC. Metagenomic study confirmed that these bacteria are in increased abundance in CRC patient as compared to healthy individuals and can cause inflammation and DNA damage which can lead to development of cancer. These bacteria produce metabolites, such as secondary bile salts from primary bile salts, hydrogen sulfide, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which are likely to promote inflammation and subsequently",
            "Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota is involved in the metabolic transformations of dietary components into oncometabolites and tumor-suppressive metabolites that in turn affect CRC development. In a healthy colon, the major of microbial metabolism is saccharolytic fermentation pathways. The alpha-bug hypothesis suggested that oncogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) induce the development of CRC through direct interactions with colonic epithelial cells and alterations of microbiota composition at the colorectal site.",
            "The relevance of specific microbial colonisation to colorectal cancer (CRC) disease pathogenesis is increasingly recognised, but our understanding of possible underlying molecular mechanisms that may link colonisation to disease in vivo remains limited. Here, we investigate the relationships between the most commonly studied CRC-associated bacteria (Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, pks+ Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium spp., afaC+ E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis & Enteropathogenic E. coli) and altered transcriptomic and methylation profiles of CRC patients, in order to gain insight into the potential contribution of these bacteria in the aetiopathogenesis of CRC. We show that colonisation by E. faecalis and high levels of Fusobacterium is associated with a specific transcriptomic subtype of CRC that is characterised by CpG island methylation, microsatellite instability and a significant increase in inflammatory and DNA damage pathways.",

Although deregulation of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has been frequently described in CRC, very little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms by which bacteria and their toxins modulate the process of tumorigenesis and behavior of cancer cells. In this study, we produced recombinant Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin-1 (rBFT1) and demonstrate that rBFT1 could promote cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells and accelerate tumor growth in vivo. To identify the mechanisms, we further investigated CCL3/CCR5 and NF-κB pathway. We found that CCL3, CCR5, NF-κB, and TRAF-6 were dramatically upregulated after rBFT1 treatment, thus suggesting that the role of rBFT1 in CRC progression may be associated with CCL3/CCR5 and NF-κB pathways.",
            "Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) are two pathobionts consistently enriched in the gut microbiomes of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to healthy counterparts and frequently observed for their direct association within tumors. Although several molecular mechanisms have been identified that directly link these organisms to features of CRC in specific cell types, their specific effects on the epithelium and local immune compartment are not well-understood. To fill this gap, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on wildtype mice and mouse model of CRC. We find that Fn and ETBF exacerbate cancer-like transcriptional phenotypes in transit-amplifying and mature enterocytes in a mouse model of CRC. We also observed increased T cells in the pathobiont-exposed mice, but these pathobiont-specific differences observed in wildtype mice were abrogated in the mouse model of CRC. Although there are similarities in the responses provoked by each organism, we find pathobiont-specific effects in Myc-signaling and fatty acid metabolism.",

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is a well-known tumor-inducing bacterium in the human gut; however, its tumorigenic effect remains to be explored. In the present study, we revealed the mechanism by which a lncRNA participates in gut bacteria-induced carcinogenesis: Bacteroides fragilis-associated lncRNA1 (BFAL1) in CRC tissues mediates ETBF carcinogenesis. BFAL1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. In vitro, BFAL1 was upregulated in ETBF-treated CRC cells.",

ETBF induces colon carcinogenesis in experimental models. Previous human studies have demonstrated frequent asymptomatic fecal colonization with ETBF, but no study has investigated mucosal colonization that is expected to impact colon carcinogenesis.METHODS: We compared the presence of the bft gene in mucosal samples from colorectal neoplasia patients (cases, n = 49) to a control group undergoing outpatient colonoscopy for CRC screening or diagnostic workup (controls, n = 49). Single bacterial colonies isolated anaerobically from mucosal colon tissue were tested for the bft gene with touch-down polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: The mucosa of cases was significantly more often bft-positive on left (85.7%) and right (91.7%) tumor and/or paired normal tissues compared with left and right control biopsies (53.1%; P = .033 and 55.5%; P = .04, respectively). Detection of bft was concordant in most paired mucosal samples from individual cases or controls (75% cases; 67% controls). There was a trend toward increased bft positivity in mucosa from late- vs early-stage CRC patients (100% vs 72.7%, respectively; P = .093). In contrast to ETBF diarrheal disease where bft-1 detection dominates, bft-2 was the most frequent toxin isotype identified in both cases and controls, whereas multiple bft isotypes were detected more fr",
            "Various studies have shown the interplay between the intestinal microbiome, environmental factors, and genetic changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. In this review, we highlight the various gut and oral microbiota associated with CRC and colorectal adenomas, and their proposed molecular mechanisms in relation to the processes of \"the hallmarks of cancer\", and differences in microbial diversity and abundance between race/ethnicity. Patients with CRC showed increased levels of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Clostridium difficile. Higher levels of Bacteroides have been found in African American (AA) compared to Caucasian American (CA) patients. Pro-inflammatory bacteria such as F. nucleatum and Enterobacter species were significantly higher in AAs. Also, AA patients have been shown to have decreased microbial diversity compared to CA patients. Some studies have shown that using microbiome profiles in conjunction with certain risk factors such as age, race and body mass index may help predict healthy colon vs one with adenomas or carcinomas.

Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless, these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution, multishell data.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison was made.RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P = .004).CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections",

Nuclear yellow or propidium iodide was injected into the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA) and 4-acetamido, 4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) into the globus pallidus (GP) of adult albino rats. SITS was chosen for the pallidal injections because it is not taken up by fibers-of-passage. The pressure injections resulted in large injection sites which covered the majority of each efferent target area, and as a result retrogradely labeled cell bodies were found throughout the entire extent of the striatum. Cell bodies double-labeled with both dyes were found intermingled with single-labeled cell bodies. In rats injected with propidium iodide in the SN-VTA and SITS in the GP, 70% of all neurons (as revealed by Nissl staining) were labeled. Of these labeled cells, 40% were double labeled, 20% contained only SITS and 40% contained only propidium iodide. Thus a substantial number of the striatal neurons that project to the SN-VTA also possess collateral axons to the GP. Some striatal neurons appear to project to only the SN-VTA or only to the GP.",

This metabolic reprogramming leads to the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite that disrupts normal cellular functions, including histone and DNA methylation processes, contributing to tumorigenesis.\n\nClinically, IDH mutations are associated with a more favorable prognosis and distinct morphological features when compared to IDH wild-type gliomas.

First, IDH mutations can produce high levels of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), thereby inhibiting glioma stem cell differentiation. At the same time, IDH mutations can upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote the formation of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, IDH mutations can also induce high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to promote glioma invasion. Ultimately, these changes will lead to the development of glioma.

IDH mutations involve the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and lead to a neomorphic ability to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) while oxidizing NADPH to NADP+. 2HG is considered as an 'oncometabolite' which is thought to be responsible for many, if not all, biologic effects of IDH mutations. 2HG accumulation competitively inhibits α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases and DNA demethylases, resulting in a hypermethylation phenotype with alterations in cellular epigenetic status as well as a block in cellular differentiation.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs), respectively, with 95% CIs.RESULTS: Total intake of fish (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96; Ptrend = .005), fatty fish (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98; Ptrend = .009), and lean fish (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-1.00; Ptrend = .016) were inversely associated with CRC incidence. Intake of total n-3 LC-PUFA (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95; Ptrend = .010) was also associated with reduced risk of CRC, whereas dietary ratio of n-6:n-3 LC-PUFA was associated with increased risk of CRC (HR for quintile 5 vs 1, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.45; Ptrend < .001).

We aimed to investigate the relationship between canned fish consumption and CRC risk. We analysed data from two case−control studies conducted between 1992 and 2010 in several Italian areas, comprising a total of 2419 incident cases and 4723 hospital controls. Canned fish consumption was analysed according to the weekly frequency of consumption as <1 serving per week (s/w) (reference category), 1 < 2 s/w, and ≥2 s/w. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression models, adjusting for several recognised confounding factors. Overall, canned fish consumption was lower among cases than among controls (23.8% vs. 28.6%). An inverse association was found between canned fish consumption and CRC risk with a significant trend in risk (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71−0.92 for intermediate consumption and OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51−0.85 for the highest one), which was consistent across strata of several covariates.",

Many factors, including genetic, immune, and environmental factors, influence the occurrence and development of CRC. Along with the economic development, changes in lifestyle, especially dietary factors, have been shown to greatly affect the progression of CRC. Increasing evidence showed that dietary patterns influence the risk of CRC and affect CRC treatment.

        "llm_evidence": "The exposome refers to the cumulative measure of environmental exposures an individual experiences throughout their lifetime, encompassing all factors outside of genetics, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants, and social interactions. It aims to capture the totality of environmental influences on health, which is believed to play a significant role in the development of diseases alongside genetic factors. The exposome can be divided into two components: the external exposome (environmental exposures such as air and water quality, chemical exposures, and socioeconomic factors) and the internal exposome (biological responses and metabolic reactions to external exposures). Understanding the exposome is crucial for identifying associations between environmental factors and health outcomes, informing public health policies, and developing personalized medicine approaches.",

            "The exposome is the analogue to the genome, from an environmental exposure perspective; research on the exposome has gained momentum only since 2011. In this work, we propose a generally applicable methodology that aims to characterise the landscape of a new research area based on linguistic analysis of its associated publications. Using abstracts of 261 exposome research articles, we illustrate a methodology that combines (1) inductive analysis based on word frequency counts, and term analysis to identify the topics, methods and applications of the new field and (2) deductive analysis using the NCBO Ontology Recommender to identify to what extent this new area is covered by current knowledge representation tools.",
            "The exposome concept arises from the need to integrate different disciplines of public health and environmental sciences, mainly including environmental epidemiology, exposure science, and toxicology. The role of the exposome is to understand how the totality of an individual's exposures throughout the lifetime can impact human health. The etiology of a health condition is rarely explained by a single exposure. Therefore, examining the human exposome as a whole becomes relevant to simultaneously consider multiple risk factors and more accurately estimate concurrent causes of different health outcomes. Generally, the exposome is explained through three domains: general external exposome, specific external exposome, and internal exposome. The general external exposome includes measurable population-level exposures such as air pollution or meteorological factors. The specific external exposome includes information on individual exposures, such as lifestyle factors, typically obtained from questionnaires.",
            "While extensive research has been conducted on the human genome and microbiome, little is known about the human exposome. The exposome comprises the totality of chemical, biological, and physical exposures that individuals encounter over their lifetimes. Traditional environmental and biological monitoring only targets specific substances, whereas exposomic approaches identify and quantify thousands of substances simultaneously using nontargeted high-throughput and high-resolution analyses. The quantified self (QS) aims at enhancing our understanding of human health and disease through self-tracking. QS measurements are critical in exposome research, as external exposures impact an individual's health, behavior, and biology.",
            "Derived from the term exposure, the exposome is an omic-scale characterization of the nongenetic drivers of health and disease. With the genome, it defines the phenome of an individual. The measurement of complex environmental factors that exert pressure on our health has not kept pace with genomics and historically has not provided a similar level of resolution. Emerging technologies make it possible to obtain detailed information on drugs, toxicants, pollutants, nutrients, and physical and psychological stressors on an omic scale. These forces can also be assessed at systems and network levels, providing a framework for advances in pharmacology and toxicology.",
            "Complementing the human genome with an exposome reflects the increasingly obvious impact of environmental exposure, which far exceeds the role of genetics, on human health. Considering the complexity of exposures and, in addition, the reactions of the body to exposures - i.e., the exposome - reverses classical exposure science where the precise measurement of single or few exposures is associated with specific health or environmental effects. The complete description of an individual's exposome is impossible; even less so is that of a population. We can, however, cast a wider net by foregoing some rigor in assessment and compensating with the statistical power of rich datasets. The advent of omics technologies enables a relatively cheap, high-content description of the biological effects of substances, especially in tissues and biofluids. They can be combined with many other rich data-streams, creating big data of exposure and effect. Computational methods increasingly allow data integration, discerning the signal from the noise and formulating hypotheses of exposure-effect relationships. These can be followed up in a targeted way. With a better exposure element in the risk equation, exposomics - new kid on the block of risk assessment - promises to identify novel exposure (interactions) and health/environment effect associations. This may also create opportunities to prioritize the more relevant chemicals for risk assessment, thereby lowering the burden on hazard assessment in an expo-sure-driven approach.",

It encompasses also \"psychosocial components\" including the impact of social relations and socio-economic position on health. In this review we provide examples of recent contributions from exposome research, where we believe their application will be of the greatest value for moving forward. So far, environmental epidemiology has mainly focused on hard outcomes, such as mortality, disease exacerbation and hospitalizations. However, there are many subtle outcomes that can be related to environmental exposures, and investigations can be facilitated by an improved understanding of internal biomarkers of exposure and response, through the application of omic technologies. Second, though we have a wealth of studies on environmental pollutants, the assessment of causality is often difficult because of confounding, reverse causation and other uncertainties. Biomarkers and omic technologies may allow better causal attribution, for example using instrumental variables in triangulation, as we discuss here. Even more complex is the understanding of how social relationships (in particular socio-economic differences) influence health and imprint on the fundamental biology of the individual. The identification of molecular changes that are intermediate between social determinants and disease status is a way to fill the gap. Another field in which biomarkers and omics are relevant is the study of mixtures. Epidemiology often deals with complex mixtures (e.g. ambient air pollution, food, smoking) without fully disentangling the compositional complexity of the mixture, or with rudimentary approaches to reflect the overall effect of multiple exposures or components. From the point of view of disease mechanisms, most models hypothesize that several stages need to be transitioned through health to the induction of disease, but very little is known about the characteristics and temporal sequence of such stages. Exposome models reinforce the idea of a biography-to-biology transition, in that everyone's disease is the product of the individual history of exposures, superimposed on their underlying genetic susceptibilities.",
            "Introduction: The exposome concept provides a framework to better incorporate the environment into the study of health and disease and has been defined by academics to encompass all lifetime exposures including toxicants, diet, and lifestyle choices. However, initial applications of the exposome concept have been less apt at measuring social determinants of health, focusing primarily on conventional environmental exposures and lifestyle choices that do not reflect the complex lived experience of many communities. To bring community voice into the exposome concept, the HERCULES Exposome Research Center and its Stakeholder Advisory Board co-developed the Exposome Roadshow. We present and discuss the resulting community-exposome definition to inform and improve exposome research.Materials and Methods: Four communities from distinct areas across metro-Atlanta participated in separate 2-day Exposome Roadshow workshops with concept mapping. Aligned with a popular education approach in which community knowledge is used to work collectively for change, concept mapping provided a systematic method to collect and visualize community members' knowledge and create a shared understanding to take action. Community members brainstormed, sorted, and rated their responses to the prompt: \"What in your environment is affecting your and your community's health?\" Responses were analyzed and visually depicted by concept maps consisting of separate but interrelated clusters of ideas. Community members discussed and validated the maps, selecting a final map illustrating their community's exposome.Results: A total of 118 community members completed concept mapping.

However, disconnect between the concept and practical application has promoted divergent interpretations of the exposome across disciplines and reinforced separation of the environmental (emphasizing exposures) and biological (emphasizing responses) research communities. In particular, while knowledge of biological responses can help to distinguish actual (i.e. experienced) from potential exposures, the inclusion of endogenous processes has generated confusion about the position of the exposome in a multi-omics systems biology context.",
            "The \"exposome\" covers all disease determinants across a lifetime. Many exposome factors could induce epigenetic changes, especially in DNA methylation. Yet, the role of these modifications in disease development remains partly understood. Although the possible relationship among the exposome factors, epigenetic modifications, and health/disease has been investigated extensively, all previous studies start from the assumption that epigenetic changes are always detrimental to (or represent an adverse effect on) the health of the affected individual. We hereby propose a new approach to investigate these modifications, and their possible relation with human health, in the context of the exposome. Our hypothesis is based on the possibility that some environmentally-induced changes are plastic entities, responding physiologically to the environment to allow individual adaptation. Briefly, after evaluating the association between environmental exposure and the variation of a given biological parameter through regression models, we use the estimated regression function to predict values for each study subject. We then calculated the relative percent difference (PD) between the measured (i.e., observed) biological parameter and the predicted (i.e., expected) from the model.",

We describe CRC incidence trends using high-quality data from 92% of the U.S. population, with an emphasis on those younger than 50 years.METHODS: We obtained 2001 to 2016 data from the U.S. Cancer Statistics database and analyzed CRC incidence for all age groups, with a focus on individuals diagnosed at ages 20 to 49 years (early-onset CRC). We compared incidence trends stratified by age, as well as by race/ethnicity, sex, region, anatomic site, and stage at diagnosis.RESULTS: We observed 191,659 cases of early-onset and 1,097,765 cases of late-onset CRC during the study period. Overall, CRC incidence increased in every age group from 20 to 54 years. Whites were the only racial group with a consistent increase in incidence across all younger ages, with the steepest rise seen after 2012. Hispanics also experienced smaller increases in incidence",

We examined racial disparities in young-onset CRC by comparing CRC incidence and relative survival among younger (<50-year-old) adults in 2 time periods.METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of cancer registries, we estimated CRC incidence rates (per 100,000 persons 20-49 years old) from 1992 through 2014 for different periods (1992-1996 vs 2010-2014) ",

In the US, CRC age-specific incidence rates increased dramatically with biologic aging for black and white men and women. For all ages, rates were slightly higher for black than for whites. Among whites, overall annual rates peaked in the 1980s then declined. Stage- and subsite-specific rate shifts suggested earlier detection of cancers through screening, particularly in the distal colon. Blacks have not experienced the same stage- and subsite temporal shifts, which were observed in whites. CRC racial differences have been attributed to biologic and/or non-biologic factors as well as to routine screening patterns.",
            "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in the United States. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC incidence, survival, and mortality rates and trends. Incidence data through 2013 were provided by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the National Program of Cancer Registries, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data through 2014 were provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. CRC incidence rates are highest in Alaska Natives and blacks and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islanders, and they are 30% to 40% higher in men than in women. Recent temporal patterns are generally similar by race and sex, but differ by age. Between 2000 and 2013, incidence rates in adults aged ≥50 years declined by 32%, with the drop largest for distal tumors in people aged ≥65 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.48-0.52) and smallest for rectal tumors in ages 50 to 64 years (male IRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.96; female IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93-1.08). Overall CRC incidence in individuals ages ≥50 years declined from 2009 to 2013 in every state except Arkansas, with the decrease exceeding 5% annually in 7 states; however, rectal tumor incidence in those ages 50 to 64 years was stable in most states.",
            "BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer rates are low among most groups of Native Americans in North America, rates for Alaska Natives have been substantially elevated compared with US rates for all races combined.METHODS: To better describe the epidemiology of colorectal cancer incidence and survival among Alaska Natives, stratified by gender and tribal/ethnic affiliation, we examined data collected by the Alaska Native Cancer Registry 1969-1993. We calculated age-adjusted and age-specific incidence as well as actuarial survival rates, and examined histological type, site, stage at diagnosis, and treatment. We compared these data to colorectal cancer data from whites living in western Washington.RESULTS: In all, 587 colorectal cancer cases were identified among Alaska Natives over the 25-year period, for an age-adjusted annual incidence rate of 71.4/100000 in women, and 69.3/100000 in men. Compared to Alaska Indians, colon cancer rates were significantly higher in Aleuts (relative risk [RR] = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2) and in Eskimos (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), while rectal cancer rates did not differ by race/ethnicity. Alaska Natives experienced a 50% higher incidence rate of colorectal cancer overall compared to western Washington whites (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.6), although rectal cancer rates were similar in the two populations. The highest RR were seen among Alaska Native women; Aleuts and Eskimos had colon cancer rates more than twice that of western Washington white women. No unusual qualitative features were found in the cancers occurring in Alaska Natives. Actuarial colorectal cancer survival rates for Alaska Natives overall were 74% at one year and 42% at 5 years; these rates were very similar to those observed for the western Washington population.

            "OBJECTIVE: National and state data document racial differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality and incidence. Screening for CRC reduces cancer incidence and deaths. Racial differences in colorectal cancer screening behavior may contribute to the racial disparity in incidence and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine if colorectal cancer screening rates are different between blacks and whites while controlling for potential confounders.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. DATA SOURCE(S)/STUDY SETTING: We used data from the North Carolina Colon Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study conducted in 33 counties of North Carolina. We analyzed data from 598 control subjects who were eligible for colorectal cancer screening.METHODS: Trained nurses conducted face-to-face interviews from October 1996 through October 2000.RESULTS: Overall, 50% of the respondents were compliant with CRC screening guidelines. In the multivariable logistic regression model having a regular doctor and participation in a general medical exam were significantly associated with current screening status with odds ratios (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 3.8 (1.7-8.3) and 3.7 (2.1-6.7), respectively. Older age was a significant predictor of current screening status with an OR (95% CI) of 2.9 (1.7-4.8) for those 60-69 compared to respondents 50-59 and OR 3.2 (1.9-5.5) for those 70 and older compared to respondents 50-59. After adjusting for age, having a regular doctor and participation in general medical exams, race was not significantly associated with current CRC screening status, with an OR of 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.6).CONCLUSION: CRC screening rates in North Carolina were low. Race was not a significant determinant of screening behavior and therefore does not explain the racial disparity in incidence or survival.

LGR6 was found as one of the novel genes mutated in colon cancer through total exon sequencing and its promoter region is hypermethylated in 20-50% of colon cancer cases. In the skin, LGR6 marks a population of stem cells that can give rise to all cell lineages. Recently, we and others demonstrated that LGR4 and LGR5 function as receptors of R-spondins to potentiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, the binding affinity and functional response of LGR6 to R-spondins, and the activity of colon cancer mutants of LGR6 have not been determined.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that LGR6 also binds and responds to R-spondins 1-3 with high affinity to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling through increased LRP6 phosphorylation. Similar to LGR4 and LGR5, LGR6 is not coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to β-arrestin following R-spondin stimulation. Functional and expression analysis of three somatic mutations identified in colon cancer samples indicates that one mutant fails to bind and respond to R-spondin (loss-of-function), but the other two have no significant effect on receptor function.

Consistent with other reports, we find that LRP6/Arrow proteins deleted for their extracellular domain are able to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Importantly, our results demonstrate that this signaling from LRP6/Arrow derivatives can occur in a Frizzled- and ligand-independent manner.

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Perforation of the Uterus**: Although rare, there is a small risk (approximately 1 in 1,000 insertions) that the IUD can perforate the uterine wall during placement, which may require surgical intervention.\n\n2. **Expulsion**: IUDs can sometimes be expelled from the uterus, which is more common in women who have never been pregnant or those who are younger. Expulsion rates can range from 2% to 10%.\n\n3. **Ectopic Pregnancy**: While IUDs significantly reduce the overall risk of pregnancy, if a pregnancy does occur, there is an increased chance it may be ectopic—occurring outside the uterus, which can be a medical emergency.\n\n4. **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)**: There is a risk of developing PID, especially within the first few weeks after insertion. PID can lead to chronic pain and fertility issues.\n\n5. **Menstrual Changes**: Users might experience heavier menstrual bleeding, longer periods, or severe cramping, particularly with copper IUDs. Hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual flow over time.\n\n6. **Sepsis**: Though extremely rare, there is a potential risk of sepsis (a severe infection) linked to IUD placement, particularly in the context of existing sexually transmitted infections.\n\n7. **Malpositioning**: In some cases, the IUD may not be positioned correctly within the uterus, leading to ineffective contraception and potential complications.\n\nThese risks highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, careful insertion by trained professionals, and ongoing monitoring in women who choose to use IUDs for contraception.",

We report herein our experience of a patient who showed complete response to chemotherapy and marked PS improvement. The patient presented with the following adverse factors poor PS, advanced progression of metastatic lesions, advanced unresectable colorectal cancer with severe stricture, and old age.PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient was an 80-year-old male diagnosed with occlusive cancer of the descending colon with multiple metastases in the liver, Stage Ⅳb (National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines version 2. 2018). A 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) + panitumumab (Pmab) regimen was successfully administered and led to decreased tumor marker levels; oral intake also became possible. Additional examinations showed that the primary lesion and distant metastatic lesions had almost disappeared; the patient had achieved a near complete response (CR). Currently, 35 cycles of mFOLFOX6＋Pmab have been administered, and his near CR has been maintained for 32 months.DISCUSSION: Best supportive care (BSC) is the recommended option for elderly patients with advanced unresectable colon cancer.

            "BACKGROUND: Within the context of metastatic colorectal cancer, patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-1 are usually pooled together in clinical practice guidelines and clinical trials' reports. The current study aims to delineate potential differences in outcomes between metastatic colorectal cancer patients with ECOG score 0 versus 1 who are treated with currently accepted first-line fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy.METHODS: The current study is based on a pooled dataset from five clinical trials of 5FU-based treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (NCT00272051; NCT00115765; NCT00305188; NCT00364013; and NCT00384176). Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ECOG score of 0-1 were eligible for the current study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between ECOG performance status and the development of different toxicities. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to clarify the impact of the ECOG score on overall and progression-free survivals. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was then used to evaluate the impact of ECOG score on overall and progression-free survivals.RESULTS: A total of 3143 patients were included in the current analysis. Within multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients with an ECOG score of 0 have a lower probability of serious adverse events (OR 0.678; 95% CI 0.583-0.788; P < 0.001), fatal adverse events (OR 0.552; 95% CI 0.397-0.766; P < 0.001), high-grade anemia (OR 0.426; 95% CI 0.252-0.721; P = 0.001), and high-grade nausea/vomiting (OR 0.697; 95% CI 0.509-0.955; P = 0.024). Through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with an ECOG score of 0 have better overall and progression-free survivals (P < 0.001 for both endpoints).

            "BACKGROUND: Performance status (PS) is a variable derived from the assessment of a patient's functional status, originally proposed to predict drug toxicity. However, despite its characteristic of being subjective and unidimensional, it has become one of the most important prognostic variables for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In light of the considerable progressive prolongation of median overall survival (OS) of patients with mCRC, it is unclear whether PS continues to be a valid prognostic factor. This article aims to perform a meta-analysis to verify the current prognostic role of PS.METHODS: A search on two databases of prospective trials of first-line chemotherapy in mCRC patients, published in English from 1991 to 2020, was done by predefined criteria. After the selection of phase III trials evaluating the prognostic role of PS, a meta-analysis has been performed.RESULTS: Thirteen trials were included in the meta-analysis. They reported a reduction in the risk of death with a PS 0 compared to a PS 1 or more (HR 0.63, CI 0.54-0.72; 13 studies), which was confirmed for the comparison between PS 0 and PS 1. However, the study found significant heterogeneity (Q = 68.10; p-value < 0.001) and high-grade inconsistency (I2 = 82.38%). Therefore, to explore the reasons for the heterogeneity, a univariate meta-regression was performed, which suggested a possible moderating activity for liver metastas",

It is based on drug-eluting microspheres pre-loaded with chemotherapeutics, which are injected selectively into vessels supplying the tumour, to embolize them inducing ischaemia, and elute the drug, to induce tumour response. We present our initial experience with novel irinotecan- loaded Embocure Plus microspheres in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer tumours in the liver, and their effect on HCT-116 cell cultures in vitro.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three consecutive male patients (median age 62 [50-76] years) with liver metastatic colorectal cancer tumours were selected. All patients had a pre-procedure contrast-enhanced computed tomography, confirming multiple metastatic liver tumours (mean tumour diameter = 42 mm; range: 14-77 mm) and periprocedural dyna-CT scans for rapid treatment results assessment.

In addition, the role of TACE in the treatment of CRCLM is also worth discussing.METHODS: This single-center retrospective study evaluated the consecutive medical records of patients with CRCLM treated with TACE from June 2014 to June 2018, who had failed at least two lines of prior chemotherapy. Therapeutic response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and complications were recorded.RESULTS: Fifty-three eligible patients were included in our study. The objective tumor radiologic regression and disease control rates were 52.8% and 79.2%, respectively. Median OS and PFS were 15 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.1 months, 16.9 months) and 6 months (95% CI 4.7 months, 7.3 months), respectively. Multivariate analysis found that synchronous metastatic disease, presence of extrahepatic metastasis, and Child-Pugh score B were independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Two patients (3.8%) had severe complications. The results of subgroup analysis showed that synchronous liver metastasis and extrahepatic metastasis had an effect on the prognosis of patients, while the primary tumor sites (rectum, left, and right colon) had no",

            "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumor entities worldwide and a common cause of cancer-associated death. Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) thereby constitute a severe life-limiting factor. The therapy of CRLM presents a major challenge and surgical resection as well as systemic chemotherapy remain the first-line treatment options. Over the years several locoregional, vascular- and image-based treatments offered by interventional radiologists have emerged when conventional therapies fail, or metastases recurrence occurs. Among such options is the conventional/traditional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) by local injection of a combination of chemotherapeutic- and embolic-agents. A similar treatment is the more recent irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads TACE (DEBIRI-TACE), which are administered using the same approach. Numerous studies have shown that these different types of chemoembolization can be applied in different clinical settings safely. Furthermore, such treatments can also be combined with other local or systemic therapies. Unfortunately, due to the incoherent patient populations of studies investigating TACE in CRLM, critics state that the definite evidence supporting positive patient outcomes is still lacking. In the following article we review studies on conventional and DEBIRI-TACE. Although highly dependent on the clinical setting, prior therapies and generally the study population, cTACE and DEBIRI-TACE show comparable results. We present the most representative studies on the different chemoembolization procedures and compare the results. Although there is compelling evidence for both approaches, further studies are necessary to determine which patients profit most from these therapies.",

Key insights supporting this conclusion include:\n\n1. **Reduced Treatment Duration**: SCRT typically involves a shorter treatment regimen (5 days) compared to long-course radiation therapy (LCRT), which can last up to 5-6 weeks. This leads to lower direct healthcare costs associated with fewer hospital visits and reduced resource utilization.\n\n2. **Similar Efficacy**: Clinical trials have shown that SCRT can achieve comparable oncological outcomes to LCRT in terms of tumor response and rates of pathological complete response (pCR), thereby validating its use as an effective neoadjuvant treatment option.\n\n3. **Quality of Life**: Patients receiving SCRT report a better quality of life during treatment, as the shorter duration minimizes treatment-related fatigue and other side effects, ultimately contributing to fewer interruptions in daily life and potentially reducing indirect costs.\n\n4. **Overall Survival and Complication Rates**: Studies indicate that SCRT does not compromise survival rates compared to LCRT and may even reduce the incidence of treatment-related complications, further enhancing its value as a cost-effective approach.\n\n5. **Cost-Effectiveness Analyses**: Economic evaluations commonly demonstrate that SCRT results in lower overall healthcare costs when taking into account both direct costs related to treatment and the indirect cost savings from improved patient quality of life and reduced complications.\n\nIn summary, short-course radiation therapy presents a compelling case for its cost-effectiveness in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer, highlighted by its reduced treatment duration, equivalent efficacy to long-course therapies, improved patient quality of life, and favorable economic evaluations.",

Recently, encouraging data on short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) for rectal cancer has emerged. In this study, we aimed to compare these two methods in terms of short-term outcomes and cost analysis under the Korean medical insurance system.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients with high-risk rectal cancer, who underwent either SCRT or LCRT followed by total mesorectal excision (TME), were classified into two groups. Twenty-seven patients received 5 Gy×5 with two cycles of XELOX (capecitabine 1000 mg/m² and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² every 3 weeks) followed by TME (SCRT group). Thirty-five patients received capecitabine-based LCRT followed by TME (LCRT group). Short-term outcomes and cost estimation were assessed between the two groups.RESULTS: Pathological complete response was achieved in 18.5% and 5.7% of patients in the SCRT and LCRT groups, respectively (p=0.223). The 2-year recurrence-free survival rate did not show significant difference between the two groups (SCRT vs. LCRT: 91.9% vs. 76.2%, p=0.394).

Current standards advise neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Nationally, compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy is only 32%. New research evaluates the effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy: complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before surgery.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the favored treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer by comparing the cost-effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care.DESIGN: Decision analytical modeling using long-term costs and 5-year disease-free survival was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness after total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in model parameters.SETTINGS: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services billing data perspective was adopted and outcomes modeled according to local and national databases and literature consensus.PATIENTS: Adult patients with stage II or III rectal cancer were selected.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness in disease-free life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net monetary benefit were determined over a 5-year posttreatment period. The favored strategy was determined based on cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness for total neoadjuvant therapy was 40,708 $/life-year, and, for conventional therapy, cost-effectiveness was 44,248 $/life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for an estimated total neoadjuvant therapy completion rate of 90%, total neoadjuvant therapy would remain the dominant strategy for any adjuvant chemotherapy completion rate of less than 93%.LIMITATIONS: The samples used to calculate completion rates are small, and survival probabilities are based on existing literature, local database va",

There is also increasing interest in the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to radiotherapy with the aim of improving disease-free survival. The relative use of SCRT and LCRT varies considerably across the world. This is reflected in, and is probably driven in part by, disparity between international guideline recommendations.

This inhibition leads to reduced oncogenic signaling, decreasing tumor cell proliferation.\n\n3. **Modulation of the Tumor Microenvironment**: By affecting the signaling pathways associated with the tumor microenvironment, regorafenib can alter the behavior of surrounding stromal cells, enhancing anti-tumor immune responses and potentially modifying the tumor's response to other therapies.\n\n4. **Induction of Apoptosis**: Regorafenib has been shown to promote apoptotic processes in tumor cells, increasing programmed cell death which is essential for reducing tumor mass.\n\nIn summary, regorafenib acts on tumor cells through inhibition of angiogenesis, direct anti-tumor activity by blocking key signaling pathways, influencing the tumor microenvironment, and inducing apoptosis, making it an effective treatment for various cancers, including colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",

For example, sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting c-Raf and other oncogenic kinases, has been used clinically for treating advanced liver and kidney tumors, and also has shown efficacy against other malignancies. However, how inhibition of oncogenic signaling by sorafenib and other drugs suppresses tumor cell growth remains unclear. In this study, we found that sorafenib kills cancer cells by activating PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a p53 target and a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein. Sorafenib treatment induces PUMA in a variety of cancer cells irrespective of their p53 status. Surprisingly, the induction of PUMA by sorafenib is mediated by IκB-independent activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which directly binds to the PUMA promoter to activate its transcription. NF-κB activation by sorafenib requires glycogen synthase kinase 3β activation, subsequent to ERK inhibition. Deficiency in PUMA abrogates sorafenib-induced apoptosis and caspase activation, and renders sorafenib resistance in colony formation and xenograft tumor assays. Furthermore, the chemosensitization effect of sorafenib is dependent on PUMA, and involves concurrent PUMA induction through different pathways. BH3 mimetics potentiate the anti-cancer effects of sorafenib, and restore sorafenib sensitivity in resistant cells. Together, these results demonstrate a key role of PUMA-dependent apoptosis in therapeutic inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. They provide a rationale for manipulating the apoptotic machinery to improve sensitivity and overcome resistance to the therapies that target oncogenic kinase signal",

Studies have shown that colorectal tumors with high levels of Top1 expression are more likely to respond favorably to irinotecan treatment, as these tumors are more susceptible to the drug's mechanism of action. Conversely, tumors with low Top1 expression have been associated with poorer outcomes and diminished sensitivity to irinotecan.\n\nMoreover, research has indicated that the effectiveness of irinotecan is influenced not just by the level of Top1 expression but also by the presence of genetic alterations in the cancer cells. Variations in the expression of related proteins and pathways can further modulate the therapeutic response.

            "Topoisomerase 1 (TOPO-1) and carboxylesterase 2 (CES-2) are found to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of various cancers. The prognostic role of TOPO-1 and CES-2 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who underwent irinotecan chemotherapy was largely unknown. In the current study, we assessed the expression of TOPO-1 and CES-2 in mCRC and analyzed its potential relevance to irinotecan based therapy. A total of 98 patients with mCRC were included in this study. The expression of TOPO-1 and CES-2 in mCRC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. For TOPO-1, 46 patients showed high expression and 52 patients showed low expression. For CES-2, 53 patients showed high expression and 45 patients showed low expression. The correlation between TOPO-1 or CES-2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of mCRC patients was analyzed. Neither TOPO-1 nor CES-2 had significant correlation with age, gender, tumor site, tumor grade and metastatic sites in mCRC patients. However, high expression of CES-2 but not TOP-1 was positively correlated with better curative effect. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were applied to assess the correlation between progression-free survival (PFS)/overall survival (OS) and TOPO-1 or CES-2 expression in mCRC patients. High expression of TOPO-1 and CES-2 are correlated with longer PFS and OS. In summary, our findings suggest that TOPO-1 and CES-2 may play important roles irinotecan sensitivity in mCRC patients.",
            "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies, and the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan (CPT-11)-based chemotherapeutic regimen is currently the first-line treatment with impressive therapeutic efficacy. However, irinotecan has several clinically significant side effects, including diarrhea, which limit its clinical utility and efficacy in many patients. In an effort to discover better and improved pharmacotherapy against colorectal cancer, we synthesized a novel topoisomerase inhibitor, PCC0208037, examined its anti-tumor efficacy and related molecular mechanisms, and characterized its toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles. PCC0208037 suppressed colorectal cancer cell (CRC) proliferation and increased cell cycle arrest, which may be related to its effects on up-regulating DNA damage response (DDR)-related molecules and apoptosis-related proteins. PCC0208037 demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in vivo in a colorectal cancer cell xenograft model, which was comparable to or slightly better than CPT-11. In a preliminary toxicology study, PCC0208037 demonstrated much weaker tissue damage to colorectal tissue than CPT-11, and its impacts on food intake and body weight loss were more transient and recovered faster than CPT-11 in mice. This could be partially explained by the pharmacokinetic findings, which showed that PCC0208037 and its active metabolite, SN-38, were more accumulated in tumor tissue than in the intestine, as compared to CPT-11.",
            "Biomarker-guided treatment for patients with colon cancer is needed. We tested ABCG2 and topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) mRNA expression as predictive biomarkers for irinotecan benefit in the PETACC-3 patient cohort. The present study included 580 patients with mRNA expression data from Stage III colon cancer samples from the PETACC-3 study, which randomized the patients to Fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FUL) +/- irinotecan. The primary end-points were recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into one group with high ABCG2 expression (above median) and low TOP-1 expression (below 75 percentile) (\"resistant\") (n = 216) and another group including all other combinations of these two genes (\"sensitive\") (n = 364). The rationale for the cut-offs were based on the distribution of expression levels in the PETACC-3 Stage II set of patients, where ABCG2 was unimodal and TOP1 was bimodal with a high expression level mode in the top quarter of the patients. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios and the association between variables and end-points and log-rank tests to assess the statistical significance of differences in survival between groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions were used for visualization and estimation of survival rates at specific time points. Significant differences were found for both RFS (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.63 (0.44-0.92); p = 0.016) and OS (HR: 0.60 (0.39-0.93); p = 0.02) between the two biomarker groups when the patients received FOLFIRI (5FUL+irinotecan). Considering only the Microsatellite Stable (MSS) and Microsatellite Instability-Low (MSI-L) patients (n = 470), the differences were even more pronounced. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the groups when patients received 5FUL alone.",

            "PURPOSE: The camptothecin (CPT) analogs topotecan and irinotecan specifically target topoisomerase I (topoI) and are used to treat colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer. Response rate for this class of drug varies from 10% to 30%, and there is no predictive biomarker for patient stratification by response. On the basis of our understanding of CPT drug resistance mechanisms, we developed an immunohistochemistry-based predictive test, P-topoI-Dx, to stratify the patient population into those who did and did not experience a response.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The retrospective validation studies included a training set (n = 79) and a validation cohort (n = 27) of gastric cancer (GC) patients, and 8 cohorts of colorectal cancer (CRC) patient tissue (n = 176). Progression-free survival for 6 months was considered a positive response to CPT-based therapy. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded slides were immunohistochemically stained with anti-phospho-specific topoI-Serine10 (topoI-pS10), quantitated, and analyzed statistically.RESULTS: We determined a threshold of 35% positive staining to offer optimal test characteristics in GC. The GC (n = 79) training set demonstrated 76.6% (95% confidence interval, 64-86) sensitivity; 68.8% (41-88) specificity; positive predictive value (PPV) 92.5% (81-98); and negative predictive value (NPV) 42.3% (24-62). The GC validation set (n = 27) demonstrated 82.4% (56-95) sensitivity and 70.0% (35-92) specificity. Estimated PPV and NPV were 82.4% (56-95) and 70.0% (35-92) respectively.

            "BACKGROUND: Though irinotecan is commonly used for treating advanced gastric cancer, there is no predictive biomarker to date. We have studied the resistant mechanism for irinotecan and found that phosphorylation of serine 10 residue of topoisomerase Ⅰ(topo Ⅰ)is an important step for irinotecan resistance. We have developed an immunohistochemical staining-based biomarker; topo Ⅰ-pS10, for predicting irinotecan efficacy.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of topo Ⅰ-pS10 immunohistochemical staining in gastric cancer clinical samples.METHODS: In this study we performed 2 sets of tests. In the training set, we stained 79 gastric cancer clinical samples which efficacy of irinotecan was measured by succinate dehydrogenase inhibition(SDI)test. In the validation set, we used 27 gastric cancer clinical samples which irinotecan was used and the efficacy was known.RESULTS: Training set: From the ROC curve the cut-off point was set at 35% positive nuclei. Sixty three cases were positive with topo Ⅰ-pS10 in the nuclei. With the result of irinotecan SDI, the sensitivity was 76.6% and the positive predictive value was 92.5%.

            "BACKGROUND: One of the main chemotherapeutic drugs used on a routine basis in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ((m)CRC) is the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, irinotecan. However, its usefulness is limited by the pre-existing or inevitable development of resistance. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BRCP) through its function in xenobiotic clearance might play an important role in irinotecan resistance. With a goal to evaluate the clinical significance of ABCG2 measurements, we here review the current literature on ABCG2 in relation to irinotecan treatment in CRC patients.RESULTS: Few studies have evaluated the association between ABCG2 gene or protein expression and prognosis in CRC patients. Discordant results were reported. The discrepancies might be explained by the use of different criteria for interpretation of results in the immunohistochemistry studies. Only one large study evaluated the ABCG2 protein expression and efficacy of irinotecan in mCRC (CAIRO study, n = 566). This study failed to demonstrate any correlation between ABCG2 protein expression in the primary tumor and response to irinotecan-based treatment. We recently raised questions on how to evaluate ABCG2 immunoreactivity patterns, and the results in the CAIRO study might be influenced by using a different scoring protocol than the",

            "Irinotecan specifically targets topoisomerase I (topoI), and is used to treat various solid tumors, but only 13-32% of patients respond to the therapy.

Notably, Australia, New Zealand, North America, and several countries in Western Europe, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany, have some of the highest reported incidences of colorectal cancer. \n\nKey insights include:\n\n1. **Lifestyle Factors**: Higher incidence rates in these regions are often linked to lifestyle factors such as diets high in red and processed meats, low physical activity, and obesity.\n   \n2. **Screening Programs**: Developed countries tend to have more advanced screening programs, which can lead to higher detection rates, thus influencing reported incidence figures.\n\n3. **Age Factor**: Colorectal cancer is more common in older populations, and countries with a higher median age may report increased incidence.\n\n4. **Geographical Variability**: Rates are generally lower in low- and middle-income countries, though rising due to Western dietary influences and urbanization. \n\n5. **Genetic Factors**: Certain populations may have genetic predispositions that contribute to higher cancer incidence.\n\nOverall, high incidence rates are primarily observed in economically developed regions, influenced by a combination of lifestyle, healthcare access, demographics, and genetic factors.",

All 10 of these countries have medium to high Human Development Index (HDI) scores. Six countries had a decrease in colon cancer incidence; these countries had the highest HDI scores; the United States had the greatest decrease, followed by Israel. Seven countries (including all countries from Northern America) had a decrease in incidence among persons older than 50 years. Eight countries had an increase in colon cancer incidence among persons younger than 50 years, including the United Kingdom and India. Countries with a decreased or stable incidence among persons 50 years or older but a significant increase in persons younger than 50 years, included Germany, Australia, the United States, Sweden, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

We aimed to examine longitudinal and generational changes in the incidence of colon and rectal cancer in seven high-income countries.METHODS: We obtained data for the incidence of colon and rectal cancer from 21 population-based cancer registries in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, New Zealand, Ireland, and the UK for the earliest available year until 2014. We used age-period-cohort modelling to assess trends in incidence by age group, period, and birth cohort. We stratified cases by tumour subsite according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Age-standardised incidences were calculated on the basis of the world standard population.FINDINGS: An overall decline or stabilisation in the incidence of colon and rectal cancer was noted in all studied countries. In the most recent 10-year period for which data were available, however, significant increases were noted in the incidence of colon cancer in people younger than 50 years in Denmark (by 3·1%), New Zealand (2·9%), Austral",

Mutations in codons 12 and 13 prevent upstream signaling inhibition by these antibodies, allowing continued tumor growth despite treatment.\n\n2. **BRAF Mutations**: Approximately 5-10% of colorectal cancers carry BRAF mutations, particularly BRAF V600E. These mutations activate downstream signaling pathways independently of EGFR, leading to resistance.\n\n3. **PIK3CA Mutations and PTEN Loss**: Alterations in the PIK3CA gene or loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, providing an alternative survival signal that diminishes the efficacy of EGFR blockade.\n\n4. **HER2 Amplification**: Some tumors may develop amplification of HER2, which can activate redundancy in signaling pathways that bypass EGFR inhibition.\n\n5. **Expression of Ligands**: Increased expression of ligands such as amphiregulin or epiregulin can lead to ligand-dependent activation of EGFR, contributing to treatment resistance.\n\nIn addition, phenotypic changes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can alter the tumor microenvironment, further complicating the response to therapy.

Although several mechanisms of resistance, both primary and acquired, have been identified, the only established predictive tumour biomarker for the treatment of mCRC patients is the RAS mutational status. RAS activating mutations predict a lack of response to these therapies while low levels of primary resistance characterize RAS wild type (WT) patients (only about 15%).

However, this was primarily on the basis of single-agent EGFRi trials and little is known about the resistance mechanisms of EGFRi combined with effective cytotoxic chemotherapy in previously untreated patients.METHODS: We analyzed paired plasma samples from patients with RAS/BRAF/EGFR wild-type metastatic CRC enrolled in three large randomized trials evaluating EGFRi in the first line in combination with chemotherapy and as a single agent in third line. The mutational signature of the alterations acquired with therapy was evaluated. CRC cell lines with resistance to cetuximab, infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, and SN38 were developed, and transcriptional changes profiled.RESULTS: Patients whose tumors were treated with and responded to EGFRi alone were more likely to develop acquired mutations (46%) compared with those treated in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy (9%). Furthermore, contrary to the generally accepted hypothesis of the clonal evolution of acquired resistance, we demonstrate that baseline resistant subclonal mutations rarely expanded to become clonal at progression, and most remained subclonal or disappeared. Consistent with this clinical finding, preclinical models with acquired resistance to either cetuximab or chemotherapy were cross-resistant to the alternate agents, with transcriptomic profiles consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. By contrast, commonly acquired resistance alterations in the MAPK pathway do not affect sensitivity t",
            ": Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) either alone or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has revolutionized the treatment of CRC, but with less results than initially envisaged. In recent years, the discovery of multiple pathways leading to the escape from anti-EGFR therapy has revealed an enormous complexity and heterogeneity of human CRC due to the intrinsic genomic instability and immune/cancer cell interaction. Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis of acquired resistance to targeted therapies represents a major challenge to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with CRC. The latest findings strongly suggest that complex molecular alterations coupled with changes of the immune tumor microenvironment may substantially contribute to the clinical efficacy of EGFR antagonist.",

The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancers.

In summary, the results identify KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers, indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months before radiographic progression and suggest early initiation of a MEK inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug resistance.",

Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy.

Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade.

Circulating 25(OH)D decreased colorectal adenoma (RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48-0.82) and CRC (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.86) risk in populations with higher calcium intake. European and American populations benefited more from vitamin D intake against colorectal tumour. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between intake of vitamin D or calcium and ",
            "PURPOSE: Although evidence suggests an inverse association between calcium intake and colorectal cancer incidence, the influence of calcium on survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis remains unclear.Experimental Design: We prospectively assessed the association of postdiagnostic calcium intake with colorectal cancer-specific and overall mortality among 1,660 nonmetastatic colorectal cancer patients within the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Patients completed a validated food frequency questionnaire between 6 months and 4 years after diagnosis and were followed up for death. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: Comparing the highest with the lowest quartile intake of postdiagnostic total calcium, the multivariable HRs were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32-0.96; P trend = 0.04) for colorectal cancer-specific mortality and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.59-1.09; P trend = 0.11) for all-cause mortality. Postdiagnostic supplemental calcium intake was also inversely associated with colorectal cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.06; P trend = 0.047) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94; P trend = 0.008), although these inverse associations were primarily observed in women.

            "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is currently considered one of the most common and lethal types of tumors. Nutrition is of notorious relevance, given its influence in CRC prevention and treatment. This systematic review aimed to revise and update the state of knowledge regarding the potential role of vitamin D and calcium as key factors involved in the prevention and treatment of CRC. A literature search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science. A total of eight studies were finally included in the present review. Vitamin D showed a protective role by promoting transcriptomic changes associated with antitumor effects. However, no significant effects of vitamin D were noted in the relapse-free survival of patients at 5 years. On the other hand, previous scientific evidence demonstrated that calcium regulates the expression of colonic proteins that decrease cell proliferation and increase cell differentiation. Nevertheless, an increased risk of associated serrated adenomas was found in response to calcium and calcium + vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, supplementation with both nutrients showed positive changes on relevant CRC biomarkers including TGFα, TGFβ1, APC, β-catenin and E-cadherin.",
            "PURPOSE: Dietary calcium intake has been suggested to be protective against the development of colorectal cancer. The mean dietary calcium intake of Koreans is 490 mg/day, which is far below the recommended calcium intake of 700-800 mg/day. In this study, we explored the relationship between dietary calcium intake and colorectal cancer development in Koreans with relatively low calcium intake compared with individuals in Western countries.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Health Examinees Study, a large-scale genomic community-based prospective cohort study, was designed to identify the general characteristics of major chronic diseases in Koreans. A total of 119,501 participants aged 40-69 years recruited between 2004 and 2013 were included in this analysis. The calcium intake level was categorized using the Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans (KDRIs). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colorectal cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: In the multivariable-adjusted model, compared with the group that consumed less than the recommended amount of calcium, the group that consumed more than the recommended intake of calcium showed a significant reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer in women.

            "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies showed that high calcium intake may be associated with the reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but results were inconclusive. In this study, we evaluated whether calcium intake from diet and supplements, as well as the calcium levels itself, were associated with the CRC risk in middle-aged and older individuals. Also, we evaluated whether these associations were modified by genetic variation of calcium homeostasis.DESIGN: This study was embedded in the Rotterdam study, a prospective cohort study among adults aged 55 years and older without CRC at baseline, from the Ommoord district of Rotterdam, The Netherlands (N = 10 941). Effect modification by a predefined polygenetic risk score (PRS) from seven loci known to be associated with calcium concentrations, was evaluated.RESULTS: The incidence rate of CRC in the study population was 2.9 per 1000 person-years. Relative to the recommended dietary calcium intake, only higher than the recommended dietary calcium intake (≥1485 mg/day) was associated with a reduced risk of CRC [hazard ratio (HR), 0.66; 95% confidence",

The present study investigated the association between these dietary intakes and the risk of colorectal cancer in Guangdong, China. From July 2010 to December 2018, 2380 patients with colorectal cancer and 2389 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Dietary intake data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a validated FFQ. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate the OR and 95 % CI after adjusting for various confounders. Higher dietary vitamin D and Ca intakes were associated with 43 and 52 % reductions in colorectal cancer risk, with OR of 0·57 (95 % CI 0·46, 0·70) and 0·48 (95 % CI 0·39, 0·61), respectively, for the highest quartile (v. the lowest quartile) intakes.

Oral calcium supplementation has been proposed as a dietary intervention for individuals at high risk of colorectal cancer because of its ability to reduce rectal epithelial cell proliferation through the binding of fatty and bile acids. Placebo-controlled studies, however, have yielded varying results.PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test oral calcium supplementation in patients at high risk of developing hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.METHODS: Thirty subjects at risk for this cancer, with an increased epithelial cell proliferation along the colon and rectum, were randomly assigned to either a placebo group (n = 15) or a treatment group (n = 15). They received either oral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) supplements (1.5 g) or placebo (cellulose and starch) three times a day during a 12-week period. Colonic biopsy specimens (rectal, sigmoidal, and descending) were obtained prior to and after the intervention trial, during endoscopy, for determination of labeling index (LI) of whole crypts and crypt compartments by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and immunohistochemistry. Proportional bile acid compositions in duodenal bile and cytolytic activity of fecal water were also determined. All P values represent two-tailed tests of statistical significance.RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions, comparing before with after intervention, in rectal whole-crypt LI after receiving either calcium supplements (from 10.9% +/- 5.2% [mean +/- SD] to 6.2% +/- 1.5%; P < .02) or placebo (from 11.7% +/- 4.7% to 8.2% +/- 3.1%; P < .05) were observed. In the three bowel segments, no statistically significant differences were observed between the supplemental calcium and placebo groups.

Several epidemiological studies and clinical trials suggest that regular use of aspirin may reduce the incidence of colorectal adenomas, particularly in individuals with certain risk factors such as a family history of colorectal cancer or previous adenomatous polyps. The mechanisms proposed for this protective effect include aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which play a role in tumorigenesis. \n\nHowever, the evidence is not definitive, and the current guidelines suggest that while aspirin may be considered for colorectal cancer prevention in some high-risk populations, it is not universally recommended for all patients due to potential side effects and the need for further research to establish optimal dosing and duration.

Many studies have confirmed the reduction of ACFs and colorectal adenomas after treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) commonly referred to as ASA; however, the minimum effective dose of ASA and the duration of use has not been fully elucidated. The objective of our study was to assess the significance of low dose ASA (75-mg internally once daily) to study the chemopreventive effect of ASA in ACF and adenomas development in patients taking this drug for a minimum period of 10 years. Materials and Methods: Colonoscopy, combined with rectal mucosa staining with 0.25% methylene blue, was performed on 131 patients. The number of rectal ACF in the colon was divided into three groups: ACF < 5; ACF 5−10; and ACF > 10. Patients were divided into two groups: the “With ASA” group (the study group subjects taking ASA 75-mg daily for 10 years); and “Without ASA” group (control group subjects not taking ASA chronically). The incidence of different types of rectal ACF and colorectal polyps in both groups of subjects was analysed and ascertained. Results: Normal ACF was found in 12.3% in the study group vs. 87.7% control group, hyperplastic 22.4% vs. 77.6%, dysplastic 25% vs. 75%, mixed 0% vs. 100%.",

Uncertainty remains about the appropriate dose of aspirin for adenoma prevention. The persistence of the protective effect of NSAIDs against recurrent adenomas after treatment cessation is yet to be established.METHODS: Our objective was to update and systematically evaluate the evidence for aspirin and other NSAIDs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas taking into consideration the risks of random error and to appraise the quality of evidence using GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Retrieved trials were evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. Meta-analytic estimates were calculated with random-effects model and random errors were evaluated with trial sequential analysis (TSA).RESULTS: In patients with a previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, low-dose aspirin (80-160 mg/day) compared to placebo taken for 2 to 4 years reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas (relative risk (RR), 0.80 [95% CI (confidence interval), 0.70-0.92]). TSA indicated a firm evidence for this beneficial effect. The evidence indicated moderate GRADE quality. Low-dose aspirin also reduces the recurrence of advanced adenomas (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.44-0.99]); however, TSA indicated lack of firm evidence for a beneficial effect. High-dose aspirin (300-325 mg/day) did not statistically reduce the recurrent adenomas (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.68-1.18]). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib 400 mg/day) were associated with a significant decrease in the recurrence of both adenomas (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.59-0.72]) and advanced adenomas (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.33-0.57]); however, this association did not persist and there was a trend of an increased risk of recurrent adenomas observed 2",

Suppression or reversal of the carcinogenic process in the colorectum with nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic agents, ie, chemoprevention, is an area of considerable research interest and activity. Interest in this field derives from multiple epidemiologic studies showing that regular and continued use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), predominantly aspirin, is associated with significant reductions in both colorectal adenoma and carcinoma incidence. NSAIDs were first shown to be effective in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Subsequent randomized trials in FAP demonstrated that sulindac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, celecoxib, can significantly regress existing adenomas, and resulted in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of celecoxib for adjunctive management of these patients.

Inclusion criteria were 1 adenoma greater than 1 cm in diameter, more than 1 adenoma of any size, or an adenoma of any size and first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer.

            "There is evidence that aspirin--and apparently other NSAIDs--may be protective agents against cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. These effects are particularly well documented in the colon and rectum. Even considered in isolation, the observational data regarding colorectal neoplasia are quite strong, and the reality of a protective effect is buttressed by clinical trial data showing that aspirin prevents sporadic adenomas. Furthermore, the NSAIDs sulindac celecoxib have actually led to the regression of existing colorectal polyps in patients with FAP. Clearly, NSAIDs have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis in the large bowel. Observational data suggesting inverse associations of NSAIDs with cancers of the stomach and esophagus have emerged from several case-control studies and a few cohort analyses. In some studies the findings display features often associated with causal relationships, for example decreasing risks with increasing doses or duration of use. Nonetheless, the data currently do not support a secure conclusion that NSAIDs protect against these malignancies. The relevant data are not nearly as extensive as those for the colorectum, and case-control investigation of these upper gastrointestinal sites may be particularly delicate. It is conceivable that early symptoms of cancer (or of pre-invasive lesions) may have discouraged NSAID use in the cancer patients, creating the appearance of a protective association of the drugs with the risk of these malignancies. More extensive observational data particularly from cohort studies would be desirable to confirm the existing findings and clarify the doses and durations of use required for an effect. Clinical trial investigation might also be practical for pre-neoplastic endpoints, or--in carefully selected populations--perhaps with cancer as the focus. There are only relatively limited data available regarding the effect of NSAIDs on cancer of the pancreas. However, the studies that have investigated this malignancy have reported indications that NSAIDs may have a protective effect. The effects of NSAIDs on cancers outside the gastrointestinal tract are not clear. Some investigations suggest that NSAID use, particularly aspirin, is inversely associated with risk of cancers of the breast or ovary, but several well-done studies have not seen these associations, and the observations could have been due to bias or confounding. Findings regarding prostate cancer are similarly conflicting. The urinary tract is one organ system in which several studies have reported an increased cancer risk in association with NSAID use. Nonetheless, the effects remain unclear. There is only limited available information regarding carcinoma of the bladder, and no firm conclusions can be drawn at this point. More extensive data have been generated regarding the effect of NSAIDs--largely salicylates--on renal cell carcinoma or cancer or the renal pelvis and ureter. Although some studies have reported increased risks, there are also findings suggesting no association. It is particularly difficult for observational studies to ascertain with confidence the true effects of aspirin because of the suspected relationship of these cancers with use of phenacetin and perhaps acetaminophen. Further data--particularly from careful and large cohort studies--would be important to clarify these issues. As a body of research, the findings discussed here from epidemiological studies and clinical trials have begun to clarify the effect of NSAIDs on carcinogenesis in various organs in humans. There is clear potential for protective effects at several anatomic sites. Even for the colorectum, however, it is probably premature to now begin to use these drugs widely for cancer prevention. To reach that point, a weighing of the risks and benefits of the drugs needs to be made, together with a judgement regarding the benefits of alternative means of prevention.",
