Key causes include:\n\n1. **Amyloidosis**: The deposition of amyloid proteins in the heart tissue, leading to stiffness and impaired function.\n2. **Sarcoidosis**: Inflammatory cells can infiltrate the heart, causing scarring and rigidity.\n3. **Endomyocardial Fibrosis**: Fibrous tissue buildup in the heart, often seen in tropical regions, impairs diastolic filling.\n4. **Infiltrative Diseases**: Conditions like hemochromatosis (iron overload) and various storage diseases can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy by accumulating abnormal substances in the myocardium.\n5. **Radiation Therapy**: Previous radiation treatment, especially to the chest area, can result in fibrotic changes in the heart muscle.\n6. **Idiopathic Causes**: In some cases, the specific cause remains unknown despite extensive investigation.\n\nUnderstanding these causes is crucial for diagnosis and management of RCM, guiding treatment and improving patient outcomes."

        "question": "Trends of acute epiglottitis in children.",
        "llm_evidence": "Acute epiglottitis in children has seen notable trends over recent decades. Historically, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the predominant pathogen causing epiglottitis, leading to significant morbidity and mortality in unvaccinated populations. However, the widespread introduction of the Hib vaccine in the early 1990s drastically reduced the incidence of epiglottitis caused by this bacterium. \n\nCurrently, the etiology of acute epiglottitis has shifted, with an increase in cases caused by other pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and non-typeable strains of H. influenzae. Additionally, there has been a rise in viral infections being associated with epiglottitis symptoms, complicating the clinical picture.\n\nEpidemiological studies indicate that while the overall incidence of acute epiglottitis has declined significantly since the vaccination era, cases are now more likely to occur in older children, with a shift toward a more diverse range of pathogens. Furthermore, there has been an observed resurgence in cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to changes in healthcare access and respiratory virus circulation patterns.\n\nKey insights include the significant impact of vaccination on the reduction of Hib-related cases, the evolving microbial landscape of acute epiglottitis, and the potential for increased incidence in non-vaccination years or pandemics, suggesting ongoing vigilance and adaptation in clinical practice."

        "question": "Is Omaveloxolone effective for Friedreich Ataxia?",
        "llm_evidence": "Omaveloxolone is a novel drug that targets the underlying mechanisms of Friedreich Ataxia (FA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, muscle weakness, and sensory loss. Clinical trials have shown that Omaveloxolone can improve functional measures in patients with FA. Specifically, a phase 2 study demonstrated significant improvements in the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) scores, which assess disease progression and motor function. The drug works by activating the Nrf2 pathway, leading to enhanced cellular antioxidant responses and potentially mitigating the neurodegenerative effects of FA. While further research and larger clinical trials are necessary to establish long-term effectiveness and safety, current evidence suggests that Omaveloxolone holds promise as a therapeutic option for managing Friedreich Ataxia."

        "question": "What non-colonic tumors are associated with Lynch syndrome?",
        "llm_evidence": "Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), primarily increases the risk of colorectal and endometrial cancers; however, it is also associated with several non-colonic tumors. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Endometrial Cancer**: Women with Lynch syndrome have up to a 60-70% lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, making it the most common non-colonic malignancy associated with the syndrome.\n\n2. **Ovarian Cancer**: There is also an elevated risk for ovarian cancer, with estimates around 10-20% for women with Lynch syndrome, particularly when related to specific gene mutations (e.g., MLH1, MSH2).\n\n3. **Gastric Cancer**: Lynch syndrome is linked to an increased incidence of gastric (stomach) cancer, especially in patients with family histories of this cancer.\n\n4. **Urinary Tract Cancers**: There is an association with urinary tract cancers, including transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and ureters.\n\n5. **Small Intestinal Cancer**: Individuals with Lynch syndrome show a higher risk for small intestine cancers compared to the general population.\n\n6. **Pancreatic and Brain Cancers**: Recent studies have suggested a potential association between Lynch syndrome and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and certain types of brain tumors, although more research is required to clarify these links.\n\nThese insights highlight the spectrum of malignancies beyond colorectal cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome, emphasizing the need for comprehensive cancer surveillance."
