        "llm_evidence": "Durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, has shown promise in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer, particularly in combination with chemotherapy and radiation. Clinical trials, such as the KEYNOTE-826 and other studies, have demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors like durvalumab can improve overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with advanced cervical cancer. The use of durvalumab in the neoadjuvant setting may enhance the immune response and contribute to better treatment outcomes. Additionally, ongoing research is focused on identifying biomarkers that predict response to durvalumab, aiding in patient selection. Overall, evidence suggests that durvalumab is a promising therapeutic option for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, especially when integrated with other treatment modalities.",

        "llm_evidence": "Several clinical conditions significantly influence the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients after liver metastasis resection. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Pre-operative Liver Function**: The Child-Pugh score, which assesses liver function, is critical. Patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) typically have better outcomes compared to those with compromised liver function (Child-Pugh B or C).\n\n2. **Number and Size of Metastases**: The number of tumor lesions and their size are crucial prognostic factors. A lower number of smaller metastases generally correlates with a better prognosis.\n\n3. **Resection Margin Status**: Achieving negative surgical margins (R0 resection) is essential for improved survival rates. Positive margins (R1 or R2) are associated with higher recurrence rates.\n\n4. **Performance Status**: The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is a critical determinant. Patients with a better performance status (ECOG 0-1) tend to have a more favorable prognosis.\n\n5. **Presence of Extrahepatic Disease**: The absence of extrahepatic disease at the time of liver surgery often indicates a better prognosis compared to patients presenting with disease spread beyond the liver.\n\n6. **Histopathological Factors**: Tumor differentiation and the presence of certain biomarkers like KRAS mutations can also influence outcomes, with well-differentiated tumors generally associated with better prognoses.\n\nThese factors collectively provide insights into the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients post-liver metastasis resection and guide clinical decision-making.",

Prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses also included age and sex.RESULTS: Five-year survival rates were 41.3% after pulmonary excision and 73.1% after primary colorectal resection. Three factors identified as significant by univariate log-rank test for overall survival after pulmonary resection were carcinoembryonic antigen (p < 0.0001), tumor laterality (p = 0.0205), and number of pulmonary metastases (p = 0.0028).

In multivariate analysis, age, status of lymph node metastasis at the primary tumour, location of primary tumour, time of appearance of the metastasis, the use of preoperative chemotherapy and the presence of extrahepatic tumour proved to be independent statistically significant predictors for the prognosis. Moreover, patients with rectal cancer had a lower intrahepatic recurrence rate, but a higher extrahepatic recurrence rate.CONCLUSION: The long-term follow-up of patients with R0-resected liver metastasis is multifactorially influenced.

Hepatectomy is the gold standard treatment for colorectal liver metastases. For patients who cannot undergo radical resection of liver metastases for various reasons, ablation therapy, interventional therapy, and systemic chemotherapy can be used to improve their quality of life and prolong their survival time.AIM: To explore the prognostic factors and treatments of liver metastases of CRC.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 patients with liver metastases from CRC treated at the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute between January 2005 and March 2011. According to different treatments, the patients were divided into the following four groups: Surgical resection group (36 patients); ablation group (23 patients); intervention group (15 patients); and drug group (13 patients). The clinicopathological data and postoperative survival of the four groups were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis.RESULTS: The median survival time of the 87 patients was 38.747 ± 3.062 mo, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 87.5% and 53.1%, respectively. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that the following factors were independent factors affecting prognosis: The degree of tumor differentiation, the number of metastases, the size of metastases, and whether the metastases are close to great vessels. The results of treatment factor analysis showed that the effect of surgical treatment was better than that of drugs, intervention, or ablation alone, and the median survival time was 48.83 ± 4.36 mo. The drug group had the worst prognosis, with a median survival time of only 13.5 ± 0.7 mo (P < 0.05). For patients with liver metastases of CRC near the great vessels, the median survival time (27.3 mo) of patients undergoing surgical resection was better than that of patients using other treatments (20.6 mo) (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Patients with a low degree of primary tumor differentiation, multiple liver metastases (number of tumors > 4), and maximum diameter of liver metastas",

It typically manifests in early childhood, between ages 1 and 8, often following other developmental disorders or cerebral injury. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Clinical Features**: LGS is defined by multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment, and an abnormal EEG pattern, often displaying slow spike-and-wave complexes. Patients may experience developmental delays and have varying degrees of cognitive impairment.\n\n2. **Causes**: The syndrome can be associated with various neurological conditions, including birth trauma, infection, malformations, and genetic syndromes. However, in many cases, the exact cause is unknown.\n\n3. **Prognosis and Management**: LGS poses a significant challenge in management. It is often resistant to treatment, with antiepileptic medications frequently failing to control seizures. Patients may require a combination of therapies, including dietary approaches like the ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, and, in some cases, surgery. \n\n4. **Quality of Life**: The condition has a profound impact on the quality of life for patients and their families due to the severity of seizures, risk of injury, and cognitive challenges. \n\nOverall, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a complex epileptic disorder with significant implications for affected individuals and their families, necessitating comprehensive, multidisciplinary management strategies.",

NF2 is less prevalent, estimated at about 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 40,000 individuals.\n\n2. **Inheritance**: Both NF1 and NF2 are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that one copy of the mutated gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This leads to a relatively consistent prevalence across different populations.\n\n3. **Global Reach**: While the prevalence can vary slightly by region due to genetic and environmental factors, NF maintains a relatively uniform incidence globally. \n\n4. **Diagnosis and Underreporting**: Awareness of the condition may affect prevalence rates; some cases may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, contributing to variations in reported prevalence.\n\nIn summary, NF1 affects approximately 1 in 3,000 people, while NF2 has a lower prevalence.

        "question": "Why does rectal cancer have worse prognosis than other colon tumors?",
        "llm_evidence": "Rectal cancer often has a worse prognosis than other colon tumors due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Anatomical Location**: Rectal tumors are located closer to the pelvic organs, making surgical excision more complex and often resulting in higher rates of incomplete resection or complications. \n\n2. **Advanced Stage at Diagnosis**: Rectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at a later stage compared to colon cancer, often due to symptoms that may be misattributed to benign conditions or delayed screening practices.\n\n3. **Histological Differences**: Rectal cancers may exhibit different histopathological features that correlate with a more aggressive behavior compared to colon cancers.\n\n4. **Treatment Challenges**: Standard treatment protocols, including neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, can be more complicated for rectal tumors, impacting survival outcomes. These tumors also tend to have a higher risk of local recurrence.\n\n5. **Patient Factors**: Rectal cancer patients often have comorbid conditions and may face variations in response to treatment influenced by factors like genetics and tumor biology.\n\n6. **Survival Rates**: Statistics indicate that five-year survival rates for rectal cancer are generally lower than those for colon cancer, underscoring the impact of these factors on patient outcomes.\n\nTogether, these insights illustrate why rectal cancer is associated with poorer prognoses compared to other colorectal cancers.",

Univariate and multivariate logistic or Cox regression and propensity score matching were used to explore the association between LNM/survival and tumor site.Results: Information for 12,404 patients, including 9655 colonic AC and 2749 rectal AC patients, was extracted from the SEER database.

The results were compared among patients with right colon (RS), left colon (LS) and rectal tumors. Results: In the entire cohort, patients with RS tumors had lower OS and lower CRS at 60 months after diagnosis than did patients with LS or rectal tumors. In the regression analysis, the localization of the primary tumor was an independent prognostic indicator for OS and CRS. Analysis by tumor stage showed that patients with RS stage III tumors had lower OS and lower CRS at 60 months than did patients with LS and rectal tumors (42%, 59% and 53%, respectively, p = 0.006; and 48%, 63% and 57%, respectively, p = 0.025).

Individuals with LDS are predisposed to a range of cardiovascular issues, including aortic dilation and aneurysm, due to abnormal connective tissue development. Studies have shown that aortic root dilation and aneurysms occur frequently in patients with LDS, often developing at a younger age compared to other connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome. Moreover, the risk of aortic dissection is significantly elevated, necessitating regular monitoring and, in many cases, surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening complications.

Key insights into its function include:\n\n1. **Regulation of Estrogen Receptor Activity**: FOXA1 acts as a pioneer factor that facilitates the binding of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) to chromatin, enabling the transcription of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. Its presence is essential for the proper functioning of the ER pathway.\n\n2. **Gene Expression Modulation**: FOXA1 directly influences the expression of numerous genes associated with the growth and progression of ER+ breast cancers, including genes related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.\n\n3. **Clinical Relevance**: Elevated levels of FOXA1 have been correlated with positive clinical outcomes in ER+ breast cancer patients, suggesting that it may serve as a biomarker for prognosis. In contrast, its dysregulation can contribute to therapeutic resistance to endocrine treatments.\n\n4. **Interactions with Other Signaling Pathways**: FOXA1 is also involved in crosstalk between estrogen signaling and other pathways, modifying the cancer cell response to targeted therapies and influencing tumor behavior.\n\nIn summary, FOXA1 is integral to the action of estrogen in ER+ breast cancer, regulating both gene expression and therapeutic responses, thereby making it a potential target for new therapeutic strategies.",

One of the purposes of using stents is palliative treatment; further, its advantages over emergency surgery with colostomy include avoidance of colostomy, relief of obstruction, shorter hospitalization, and better quality of life. In addition, stent placement can also be used as a bridge to surgery since the duration of the hospitalization is shorter and postoperative complications, colostomy rates, and mortality rates are lower with elective than with emergency surgery. Although recent studies have reported low complication rates related to colonic stents, complications may still occur, highlighting the importance of good preparation, adequate staffing, backup systems, and informed consent.

The safety and oncological effect of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) in these patients remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate its impact on these variables and compare it with that of emergency surgery (ES).METHODS: Descriptive, retrospective and single-centre study, performed between 2008 and 2015, with follow-up until 2017. One hundred eleven patients with diagnosis of left malignant colonic obstruction were included and divided according to the treatment received: stent as bridge to surgery (SBTS group: 39), palliative stent (PS group: 30) and emergency surgery with curative (ECS group: 34) or palliative intent (EPS group: 8). Treatment was decided by the attending surgeon in charge.RESULTS: Technical and clinical general success rates for colorectal SEMS were 95.7% and 91.3%, respectively, with an associated morbimortality of 23.2%, which was higher in the PS group (p = 0.002). The SBTS group presented a higher laparoscopic approach and primary anastomosis (p < 0.001), as well as a lower colostomy rate than the ECS group (12.8% vs. 40%; p = 0.023). Postoperative morbidity and mortality were significantly lower in the SBTS group compared to the ECS group (41% vs. 67.6%; p = 0.025).

It shortens hospital stays, decreases healthcare cost, reduces permanent stoma rates, and expedites the start of chemotherapy.

We will discuss the benefits and risks of stenting in palliative setting and as bridge-to-surgery. Quality of life, hospital stay, and health care cost will also be considered.CONCLUSION: Non-traversable colon masses during endoscopy are considered a risk factor of development of intestinal obstruction but preventive stent placement in patients without obstructive symptoms is not recommended. The risk of technical or clinical failure is significant at 25%. If stent placement allows neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it may increase the rate of R0 resections. Perforations may r",

Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that can increase the likelihood of transcription of specific genes. They can function independently of their distance from the promoter, often looping to facilitate contact with the promoter region, effectively driving gene expression.\n\nKey insights include:\n1. **Functional Overlap**: Enhancers and promoters both contain binding sites for transcription factors, allowing enhancers to recruit co-activators and the RNA polymerase complex necessary for transcription initiation.\n2. **Context-Dependent Activity**: In some cases, when a promoter is weak or not functioning optimally, enhancers can compensate and initiate transcription, leading to the expression of the gene they regulate.\n3. **Chromatin Structure**: The three-dimensional arrangement of chromatin can allow enhancers to interact with promoters over long distances, thereby influencing transcription in a manner akin to that of traditional promoters.\n4. **Developmental and Cellular Specificity**: Enhancers can drive gene expression in specific tissues or developmental stages, leading them to take on a promoter-like role in activating particular genes when required.\n\nOverall, this functional plasticity demonstrates that while enhancers are distinct from promoters, they can exhibit promoter-like properties under specific biological contexts.",

In cases of chronic pain, other medications may be considered, such as gabapentin or duloxetine, which provide nerve pain relief.\n\n3. **Occupational Therapy**: OT can assist patients in learning how to adapt daily activities and use assistive devices to minimize strain on their joints and reduce pain.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Incorporating lifestyle changes, such as low-impact activities and maintaining a healthy weight, can reduce stress on joints and manage pain effectively.\n\n5. **Psychological Support**: Chronic pain is often linked with psychological distress; hence, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pain management programs can help patients cope with the emotional aspects of living with EDS.\n\n6. **Complementary Therapies**: Techniques such as acupuncture, massage therapy, or mindfulness practices may also provide additional relief for pain in some patients, although results can vary.\n\nIn summary, effective pain management for individuals with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome generally involves a combination of medication, physical and occupational therapy, lifestyle adaptations, psychological support, and complementary therapies, customized to the patient's specific needs and symptomatology.",

However, secondary resistance to Bevacizumab can develop through several molecular mechanisms:\n\n1. **Alternative Angiogenic Pathways**: Tumors may upregulate alternative pro-angiogenic factors such as PlGF (Placental Growth Factor), FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor), and VEGF isoforms that bypass Bevacizumab's blockade, leading to sustained angiogenesis.\n\n2. **Genetic Mutations**: Mutations in key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, such as KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, can promote tumor progression and survival despite anti-VEGF therapy. For instance, activating mutations in the PI3K pathway can cause resistance by promoting cell survival and proliferation.\n\n3. **Hypoxia-Induced Adaptations**: Tumors can adapt to low oxygen levels by increasing expression of hypoxia-induced factors (HIFs), which can stimulate angiogenesis and enhance tumor aggressiveness, counteracting the effects of Bevacizumab.\n\n4. **Tumor Microenvironment Changes**: The tumor microenvironment, including immune cell infiltration and stromal interactions, can shift in response to Bevacizumab treatment, potentially leading to the recruitment of pro-tumorigenic cells and increased resistance.\n\n5. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)**: Tumors may release EVs that carry proteins and RNAs that facilitate signaling to promote angiogenesis and resistance mechanisms, including those that enhance immunosuppression.\n\nUnderstanding these molecular adaptations is crucial for developing next-generation therapies that can overcome resistance and improve outcomes for advanced CRC patients treated with Bevacizumab.",

The lack of available diagnostics to discriminate viral and bacterial etiologies contributes to this discordance. Recent efforts have focused on the host response as a source for novel diagnostic targets although none have explored the ability of host-derived microRNAs (miRNA) to discriminate between these etiologies. Methods: In this study, we compared host-derived miRNAs and mRNAs from human H3N2 influenza challenge subjects to those from patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Sparse logistic regression models were used to generate miRNA signatures diagnostic of ARI etiologies. Generalized linear modeling of mRNAs to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes allowed analysis of potential miRNA:mRNA relationships. High likelihood miRNA:mRNA interactions were examined using binding target prediction and negative correlation to further explore potential changes in pathway regulation in response to infection. Results: The resultant miRNA signatures were highly accurate in discriminating ARI etiologies. Mean accuracy was 100% [88.8-100; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)] in discriminating the healthy state from S. pneumoniae pneumonia and 91.3% (72.0-98.9; 95% CI) in discriminating S. pneumoniae pneumonia from influenza infection. Subsequent differential mRNA gene expression analysis revealed alterations in regulatory networks consistent with known biology including immune cell activation and host response to viral infection. Negative correlation network analysis of miRNA:mRNA interactions revealed connections to pathways with known immunobiology such as interferon regulation and MAP kinase signaling.

Key insights into their function include:\n\n1. **Gene Activation:** eRNAs are produced in proximity to enhancers and have been shown to assist in the recruitment of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to the promoter regions of target genes, thereby enhancing transcription.\n\n2. **Chromatin Remodeling:** eRNAs can promote changes in chromatin structure, making it more accessible for the transcriptional machinery. This facilitates a more active state of the enhancer-promoter interaction.\n\n3. **Interplay with Transcription Factors:** eRNAs can interact with specific transcription factors and cofactors, stabilizing their binding and influencing gene expression patterns. This interaction often occurs in a cell-type specific manner, contributing to cellular diversity.\n\n4. **Regulatory Networks:** eRNAs are involved in forming complex regulatory networks. They can act in trans—regulating distant genes—or in cis, directly influencing nearby gene expression, thereby contributing to the fine-tuning of cellular responses.\n\nOverall, eRNAs are essential for mediating the effects of enhancers on gene transcription, shaping the dynamics of gene expression in response to various cellular cues.",

            "CMV infection. Post-natal CMV (pCMV) infection is most commonly transmitted by breast-feeding, and in full-term infants is of little consequence. However, in preterm, very-low birthweight (VLBW) infants (<1500 g), pCMV can result in a severe sepsis-like syndrome, with wide-ranging end-organ disease manifestations. Although such short-term complications are well recognized among clinicians caring for premature infants, the long-term risks with respect to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes remain controversial. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical manifestations of breast milk-acquired pCMV infection. In particular, we summarize studies that have examined-sometimes with conflicting conclusions-the risks of long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in VLBW infants that acquire pCMV from breast milk. We highlight proposed preventive strategies and antiviral interventions, and offer recommendations for high-priority areas for future basic science and clinical research.",

H3K27ac is often associated with active regulatory elements, while H3K4me1 is typically found at both active and poised enhancers.\n\n2. **DNase I Hypersensitivity**: Regions corresponding to active enhancers show increased sensitivity to DNase I digestion, indicating a more open and accessible chromatin structure. This is often assessed through DNase-seq or ATAC-seq methodologies.\n\n3. **Presence of Pioneer Factors**: Active enhancers frequently bind transcription factors, particularly \"pioneer factors\" that can initiate and maintain an open chromatin state, thereby facilitating the recruitment of additional co-activators and RNA polymerase II.\n\n4. **Enhancer RNA (eRNA) Production**: Active enhancers often produce non-coding RNA molecules called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which can play a role in promoting gene expression.\n\n5. **Chromatin Looping**: Active enhancers frequently form physical interactions with target gene promoters through chromatin looping, which is mediated by various co-activators and architectural proteins like CTCF.\n\nOverall, the signature of active enhancers is characterized by specific histone modifications, an accessible chromatin state, binding of regulatory proteins, and functional output in the form of eRNA production and DNA looping.",

The anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents, Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, have been granted FDA approval for this subset of patients. Unfortunately, however, not all CRC cases with the dMMR-MSI-H phenotype respond well to ICIs, and ongoing studies are currently exploring biomarkers that can predict good response to them. Another challenge lies in developing novel treatment strategies for the subset of patients with the mismatch repair-proficient-microsatellite instability-low (pMMR-MSI-L) phenotype that comprises 95% of all mCRC cases in whom treatment with currently approved ICIs has been largely unsuccessful. Approaches aiming at overcoming the resistance of tumors in this subset of patients are being developed including combining different checkpoint inhibitors with either chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer (ACT), or bispecific T-cell (BTC) antibodies. This review describes the rationale behind using immunotherapeutics in CRC. It sheds light on the progress made in the use of immunotherapy in the treatment of patients with dMMR-MSI-H CRC.

        "llm_evidence": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is primarily caused by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes. Approximately 85% of ADPKD cases are associated with mutations in the PKD1 gene, located on chromosome 16, which codes for the polycystin-1 protein. This protein plays a crucial role in kidney development and cellular function. The remaining cases are linked to mutations in the PKD2 gene on chromosome 4, which encodes polycystin-2. Both proteins are involved in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining the structure of renal tubular cells. The inheritance pattern of ADPKD is autosomal dominant, meaning that only one mutated copy of the gene from an affected parent is sufficient to cause the disease. Over time, these mutations lead to the formation of numerous cysts in the kidneys, eventually resulting in kidney dysfunction and associated complications.",

Among these, the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) often emerges as the most cost-effective screening method for the general population. \n\nKey insights supporting this conclusion include:\n\n1. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: Studies show that FIT has a lower upfront cost compared to colonoscopy and is less invasive, making it more accessible. This leads to higher adherence rates in the general population and can significantly reduce CRC mortality.\n\n2. **Frequency of Testing**: FIT can be done annually, which facilitates regular screening. In contrast, colonoscopy, recommended every 10 years, can deter patients from screening due to its more invasive nature.\n\n3. **Early Detection**: Regular FIT screening has been associated with early detection of CRC, which is critical for treatment success and reducing healthcare costs associated with advanced-stage cancer treatment.\n\n4. **Healthcare System Implications**: Implementing a FIT-based screening program can reduce the burden on healthcare systems by decreasing the number of unnecessary colonoscopies, thus allowing resources to be allocated more efficiently.\n\nIn conclusion, based on cost, accessibility, and the effectiveness of screening in reducing CRC mortality, FIT is typically regarded as the most cost-effective option for the general population.",

In this study, when screening techniques were compared to no-screening, all CRC screening techniques showed to be cost-effective. The lowest ICER calculated was $PPP -16265/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (the negative ICERs were between purchasing power parity in US dollar ($PPP) -16265/QALY to $PPP -1988/QALY, whereas the positive ICERs were between $PPP 1257/QALY to $PPP 55987/QALY).

Although immunochemical fecal tests (FIT) and guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (g-FOBT) have been shown to be cost-effective in France, cost-effectiveness of endoscopic screening has not yet been addressed.METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of screening strategies using colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, second-generation colon capsule endoscopy (CCE), FIT and g-FOBT were compared using a Markov model. A 40 % adherence rate was assumed for all strategies. Colonoscopy costs included anesthesiologist assistance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Probabilistic and value-of-information analyses were used to estimate the expected benefit of future research. A third-payer perspective was adopted.RESULTS: In the reference case analysis, FIT repeated every year was the most cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of €48165 per life-year gained vs. FIT every 2 years, which was the next most cost-effective strategy. Although CCE every 5 years was as effective as FIT 1-year, it was not a cost-effective alternative. Colonoscopy repeated every 10 years was substantially more costly, and slightly less effective than FIT 1-year. When projecting the model outputs onto the French population, the least (g-FOBT 2-years) and most (FIT 1-year) effective strategies reduced the absolute number of annual CRC deaths from 16037 to 12916 and 11217, respectively, resulting in an annual additional cost of €26 million and €347 million, respectively.

This deletion typically involves a range of genetic material, which can lead to various developmental and physical challenges. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Chromosomal Deletion**: CdCS results from a deletion of a segment of the 5th chromosome, which impacts gene function and expression, leading to the distinctive features of the syndrome.\n\n2. **Clinical Features**: Individuals with CdCS often exhibit a characteristic high-pitched cry resembling that of a cat (hence the name), intellectual disability, delayed development, and distinctive facial features which may include a rounded face, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and a small chin.\n\n3. **Inheritance Patterns**: The majority of cases arise from new (de novo) mutations, meaning they typically do not follow classical inheritance patterns. However, in some instances, the deletion can be inherited from a parent who is also a carrier of the chromosomal abnormality.\n\n4. **Genetic Testing**: Cytogenetic techniques, such as chromosomal microarray analysis, can confirm the diagnosis by identifying the deletion on chromosome 5.\n\nIn summary, Cri du Chat syndrome is a genetic condition caused by deletions on the short arm of chromosome 5, leading to a distinct set of phenotypic characteristics and developmental issues.",

However, the safety and efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens for elderly patients remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study ",
            "The value of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients has been the subject of many overviews, with opinions varying from \"not effective\", since randomized trials have not been performed, to \"as effective as in young individuals\", based upon many retrospective analyses of randomized trials that have included patients of all ages. In the absence of randomized trials performed specifically with elderly patients, retrospective analyses demonstrate that the influence on the time to tumour recurrence (TTR) may be the same as in young individuals, but that endpoints that include death for any reason, such as recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), are poorer in the elderly. This is particularly true if oxaliplatin has been part of the treatment. The need for adjuvant chemotherapy after colorectal cancer surgery in elderly patients is basically the same as that in younger patients. The reduction in recurrence risks may be similar, provided the chosen treatment is tolerated but survival gains are less. Adding oxaliplatin to a fluoropyrimidine is probably not beneficial in individuals above a biological age of approximately 70 years. If an oxaliplatin combination is administered to elderly patients, three months of therapy is in all probability the most realistic goal.",

The aim of the present study is to review appropriate chemotherapeutic regimens for elderly patients.

The efficacy of adjuvant therapy was analyzed in association with age and adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens. A total of 507 patients (45%) were ≥70 years old.

Immunotherapy aims to enhance the body’s natural immune response to identify and attack cancer cells. \n\nKey insights include:\n\n1. **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors**: Melanoma often expresses proteins, such as PD-L1, that inhibit T-cell activation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, block these proteins, allowing T-cells to recognize and kill melanoma cells more effectively.\n\n2. **T-cell Receptor Therapies**: Another approach is the use of T-cell receptor (TCR) therapies, where T-cells are engineered to target specific melanoma antigens. This provides a more direct attack on tumor cells.\n\n3. **Tumor Microenvironment**: Melanomas can create a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Immunotherapies can modify this environment, reducing immunosuppressive signals and promoting a stronger immune response.\n\n4. **Durability of Response**: Immunotherapy has shown the potential for long-lasting responses in melanoma patients, with some individuals experiencing durable remissions, unlike traditional therapies which may only provide temporary benefit.\n\n5. **Personalized Medicine**: Biomarkers, such as mutations in the BRAF gene, allow for personalized approaches, combining immunotherapy with targeted therapies for enhanced efficacy.\n\nOverall, therapies leveraging the immune system provide a promising avenue for treating melanoma, particularly given the aggressive nature of the disease and its ability to metastasize rapidly.",

Humans can become infected when they come into contact with infected equine species, as horses can act as an intermediate host. The virus can also spread within the human population through close contact with an infected person or contaminated materials. Evidence indicates that a significant mode of transmission is through caretaking of infected horses, as well as potential exposure in environments where infected bats live or forage.

        "llm_evidence": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is primarily caused by the loss of function of genes in a specific region of chromosome 15, typically due to three genetic mechanisms. The most common cause (approximately 70% of cases) is a deletion of paternal genes in the 15q11-q13 region. Another significant cause (about 25% of cases) is uniparental disomy, where a child inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother and none from the father. A rarer cause (1-3% of cases) involves imprinting defects, where the paternal genes are present but not expressed due to improper genomic imprinting. The disruption of these genes leads to the characteristic symptoms of PWS, including hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, and developmental delays. Understanding these genetic mechanisms is crucial for diagnosis and potential future therapies.",

Studies suggest that local tumor control is increased in some visceral tumor types, especially with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In some other studies, a better control of systemic disease has contributed to significantly improved survival rates. Additionally, delaying surgery offers the chance to bring the patient into a better general condition for major surgery, but it also confers the risk of progression. Although it is a relatively rare event, cancers may progress locally during neoadjuvant treatment or distant metastases may occur, jeopardizing a curative surgical treatment approach. Although this is seen as risk of neoadjuvant treatment, it can also be seen as a chance to select only those patients for surgery who have a better control of systemic disease. Some studies showed increased perioperative morbidity in patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment, which is another potential disadvantage. Optimal multidisciplinary teamwork is key to controlling that risk. Meanwhile, the neoadjuvant treatment period is also used as a \"window of opportunity\" for studying the activity of novel drugs and for investigating predictive and prognostic biomarkers of chemoradiotherapy and radiochemotherapy.",

            "Research into novel therapies for PKU has taken many different approaches to address the lack of PAH activity at the core of this disorder: enzyme replacement via virus-mediated gene transfer, transplantation of donor liver and recombinant PAH protein, enzyme substitution using phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to provide an alternative pathway for the metabolism of phenylalanine, and restoration of native PAH activity using chemical chaperones and nonsense read-through agents.",
            "Here, we show that a liver-directed PAH gene transfer brought about long-term correction of hyperphenylalaninemia and behavioral improvement in a mouse model of PKU. A recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying the murine PAH cDNA was constructed and administered to PAH-deficient mice (strain PAH(enu2)) via the portal vein. Within 2 weeks of treatment, the hyperphenylalaninemic phenotype improved and completely normalized in the animals treated with higher vector doses. The therapeutic effect persisted for 40 weeks in male mice, while serum phenylalanine concentrations in female animals gradually returned to pretreatment levels. Notably, this long-term correction of hyperphenylalaninemia was associated with a reversal of hypoactivity observed in PAH(enu2) mice. While locomotory activity over 24 h and exploratory behavior were significantly decreased in untreated PAH(enu2) mice compared with the age-matched controls, these indices were completely normalized in 12-month-old male PKU mice with lowered serum phenylalanine.",
            "Current therapy for phenylketonuria (PKU) consists of life-long dietary restriction of phenylalanine (Phe), which presents problems of adherence for patients. Alternative therapies under investigation include, among others, the use of gene therapy to provide copies of wild-type, non-mutant, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Expression of PAH in both liver (the usual metabolic source of this enzyme) and skeletal muscle is under investigation. Liver gene therapy, using a viral vector based on the adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), provided effective clearance of serum Phe that was sustained for 1 year in some mice. In order for PAH expression to be effective in skeletal muscle, the essential metabolic cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), must also be provided, either by supplementation or gene therapy. Both these approaches were effective. When transgenic PKU mice that constitutively expressed PAH in muscle were given intraperitoneal supplementation with BH(4), this produced (transient) effective clearance of Phe to normal levels. In addition, use of an AAV vector containing the genes for PAH, and for two key synthetic enzymes for BH(4), provided substantial and long-lasting correction (more than 1 year) of blood Phe levels when injected into skeletal muscle of PKU mice. These two strategies provide promising treatment alternatives for the management of PKU in patients.",

Although this therapeutic effect did not persist, analysis of the relationship between hepatic PAH activity and serum phenylalanine levels indicated that only 10-20% of normal enzymatic activity in the mouse liver is sufficient to restore normal serum phenylalanine levels. These results demonstrate that PKU and other metabolic disorders secondary to hepatic deficiencies can be completely corrected by gene therapy when more persistent vector systems are developed.",
            "We explored a gene therapy approach aimed at long-term correction of the pathologic phenotype of BTBR-PahEnu2 mice, a mouse model of PKU. To this aim, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vector expressing phenylalanine hydroxylase and administered it to 3-week-old PKU mice. This resulted in complete normalization of Phe and Tyr levels and reversal of coat hypopigmentation that lasted throughout the observation period of six months. The spatial learning deficits observed in PKU mice were also reversed and hippocampus levels of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate and 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid receptor subunits returned to normal. Long-term potentiation, which is impaired in PKU mice, was also restored by treatment. Therefore, HD-Ad vector-mediated gene therapy is a promising approach to PKU treatment.",

This gene plays a crucial role in brain development and the regulation of other genes. The disorder typically affects females, as they have two X chromosomes, and most mutations in MECP2 lead to a loss of function of the protein it encodes. The onset of symptoms usually occurs between 6 months and 2 years of age, following a period of normal development. Key insights include that the disorder is not inherited in a traditional manner, as most cases arise from de novo mutations. These mutations disrupt normal neural function and synaptic connections, leading to the characteristic symptoms of Rett Syndrome, which include loss of purposeful hand skills, speech, and motor coordination, along with repetitive hand movements.

            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental regression between 6 and 18 months of life and associated with multi-system comorbidities. Caused mainly by pathogenic variants in the MECP2 (methyl CpG",
            "Rett syndrome (RS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder first described in 1966. It is characterized by the arrest and regression of intellectual, motor, and communicative developmental milestones, followed by the appearance of hand stereotypies after an apparently normal development period. Pathogenic variants in the MECP2 gene have been identified as a cause in most cases. The following review focuses on analyzing updated information regarding the medical and social aspects of RS globally, with a special emphasis of the situation",
            "In 1999, mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified as the primary cause of Rett syndrome.",
            "Rett syndrome, one of the leading causes of mental retardation and developmental regression in girls, is the first pervasive developmental disorder with a known genetic cause. The majority of cases of sporadic Rett syndrome are caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2).",
            "In 1999, mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified as the primary cause of Rett syndrome. MECP2 mutations can be found in 70% to 80% of all clinically defined Rett syndrome cases; in classic Rett syndrome, this frequency is even higher. In most cases, missense and nonsense mutations affecting functionally important domains can be found.",
            "Recently, mutations in the gene encoding X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) have been identified as the cause of Rett syndrome. Along with the classic form, variant forms of Rett syndrome and Rett syndrome phenotypes are also recognized.",
            "The majority of cases of sporadic Rett syndrome are caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 binds methylated DNA and likely regulates gene expression and chromatin structure.",
            "Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder with a well-defined clinical spectrum and course. Recently, mutations in the gene encoding X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) have been identified as the cause of Rett syndrome.",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is one of the most common causes of intellectual and developmental disabilities in girls, and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). Here we will review our current understanding",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying RTT, four",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an extremely invalidating, cureless, developmental disorder, and it is considered one of the leading causes of intellectual disability in female individuals. The vast majority of RTT cases are caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, which encodes a multifunctional reader of methylated DNA. MeCP2",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare, X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder typically affecting females, resulting in a range of symptoms including autistic features, intellectual impairment, motor deterioration, and autonomic abnormalities. RTT is primarily caused by the genetic mutation of the Mecp2 gene. Initially",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs mainly in girls with a range of typical symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. MeCP2 protein loss-of-function in neural lineage cells is the main cause",
            "Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in MECP2, the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2.",
            "In up to 96% of all classic cases, Rett syndrome cases are caused by mutations or deletions in MECP2.",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder of genetic origin, caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2).",
            "Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly caused by de novo mutations in the MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) gene.",
            "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene.",
            "Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls. About 80% of classic Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) in Xq28.",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting almost exclusively girls. It is currently considered a monogenic X-linked dominant disorder due to mutations in MECP2 gene, encoding the methyl-CpG binding protein 2.",
            "RTT is known to be caused in 95% of the cases by sporadic de novo loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein able to regulate gene expression.",
            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant postnatal severe and disabling neurodevelopmental disorder which is the second most common cause for genetic mental retardation in girls and the first pervasive disorder with a known genetic basis. The syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene on Xq28.",
            "RTT is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, which encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2.",
