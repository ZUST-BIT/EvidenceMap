        "llm_evidence": "Rozanolixizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and has been primarily investigated for its role in treating autoimmune diseases, particularly myasthenia gravis. Its mechanism involves reducing the levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies by preventing their recycling, which could theoretically apply to other autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). \n\nWhile current clinical trials have predominantly focused on neuromuscular conditions, the underlying immunological principles might suggest potential applicability to MS, where IgG-mediated processes play a significant role in disease pathology. However, as of October 2023, specific trials and data supporting the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab specifically for MS is limited. Thus, while there is a theoretical basis for consideration, more targeted research and clinical evidence are needed to establish its effectiveness and safety as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.",

Key insights include:\n\n1. **KRAS Mutations**: Mutations in the KRAS gene, particularly in codons 12 and 13, are well-documented as primary biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies such as cetuximab and panitumumab. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the RAS signaling pathway, rendering anti-EGFR treatment ineffective.\n\n2. **NRAS Mutations**: Similar to KRAS, mutations in the NRAS gene (especially in codon 61) can also confer resistance to anti-EGFR therapies, as they activate downstream signaling that bypasses the need for EGFR activation.\n\n3. **BRAF Mutations**: Mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly the V600E mutation, are associated with a poor response to anti-EGFR therapy. BRAF mutations activate downstream MAPK signaling independent of EGFR, resulting in continued tumor growth despite the presence of anti-EGFR drugs.\n\n4. **PIK3CA Mutations**: Alterations in the PIK3CA gene can contribute to resistance by activating the PI3K signaling pathway, providing an alternative route for cancer cell survival and proliferation even when EGFR signaling is inhibited.\n\n5. **EGFR Amplification and Alterations**: In some cases, tumor cells may develop resistance through amplification of the EGFR itself or through mutations in the EGFR gene that alter the receptor's ligand-binding properties, thus allowing for continued signaling in the presence of anti-EGFR therapies.\n\nUnderstanding these mutations helps tailor treatment strategies and explore alternative therapies, such as combining anti-EGFR agents with inhibitors targeting other pathways affected by these mutations.",

We performed a screening of 1,039 CRC samples to assess the prevalence of KRAS amplification in this tumor type and further evaluated the role of this genetic alteration on the sensitivity to anti EGFR therapies. We detected KRAS amplification in 7/1,039 (0.67%) and 1/102 evaluable CRC specimens and cell lines, respectively. KRAS amplification was mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations.

Whereas extensive and combined deformities of the ventral chest wall are classically corrected using a so-called minimally invasive repair of the pectus excavatum, a modified Ravitch repair, or the minimized Erlangen repair, plastic surgeons are mostly challenged with alloplastic implant corrections of mild funnel chests. The authors have introduced an endoscopic method for placement of customized implants to restore the visible and nonfunctionally disturbing deformation of mild funnel chests when only the sternal plate is involved. This study compared these different plastic surgical and thoracic surgical approaches in a multicenter experience to develop a clinical algorithm and to identify those patients not requiring bony correction but rather alloplastic endoscopic implant correction alone.METHODS: Patients with deformed rib cages and sternal plates were treated with the Erlangen minimally invasive procedure or a modified Ravitch procedure. For deformities involving the sternal bones only, endoscopically assisted minimally invasive implantation of silastic implants was performed.RESULTS: Between 1987 and 2003, 599 patients with a pectus excavatum deformity were treated surgically by the authors' group. Between 1999 and 2003, 515 patients underwent surgery using the Erlangen minimally invasive repair technique at Friedrich-Alexander University-Erlangen. In addition, 84 patients underwent surgery at the Freiburg University Medical Center. In the current series, 79 patients underwent surgery using the modified Ravitch method. The mean patient age was 20.5 years (range, 3-54 years), and the rate of postoperative relapses was 5%. The findings showed that 73% of the patients judged the aesthetic result as excellent to good, and 20% were satisfied. In contrast, only five patients were suitable for soft tissue augmentation only. Two of these patients in the initial period received custom implants presternally via classical transverse skin incisions, whereas three patients were treated with endoscopic customized implant tissue augmentation.CONCLUSION: Whereas with combined deformity of the sternal plate and the rib cage, a modified Ravitch repair yields good results, the endoscopic soft tissue correction with customized implants helps to avoid unsightly scars, allows for safe hemostasis in the dissection pocket, and leads to enhanced patient satisfaction.

To date, no studies directly evaluate the outcome of the new technique versus that of the conventional technique. From 2000 to 2002, 28 patients underwent pectus excavatum correction in the authors' hospital. Twenty-one were treated by minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum and seven patients had open correction. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, clinical outcome, and patient satisfaction were evaluated. In the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum group, the children were younger (14.4 +/- 2.9 versus 17.8 +/- 3.2 years), had shorter operation times (53 +/- 18 versus 125 +/- 6 minutes), and had less blood loss (minimal versus 380 +/- 175 ml). No intraoperative complications were recorded. In the conventional group, two pleural lacerations occurred. Early postoperative complications in the minimally invasive repair group included two pneumothoraces and one case of pleural effusion. In the conventional group, one pneumothorax and one case of pleural effusion occurred. Late postoperative complications in the Nuss group included one costal erosion, two bar dislocations, one severe wound infection requiring bar removal, one hematothorax, and one case of postpericardiotomy syndrome; in the conventional group, there was one severe wound infection. In both groups, the patients rated their cosmetic results as good to very good. Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum is a novel method with clear advantages, such as limited surgical trauma and small scars.

Ravitch's methods have been modified using autologous or exogenous materials to fix the lower sternum. Nuss reported a novel method in which neither an anterior wound nor the cutting of cartilage or sternum is required; instead, a convex metal bar is placed behind the sternum. We have reported sternocostal elevation, in which a section of costal cartilage is resected, and all of the cartilage stumps are resutured to the sternum. The secured ribs pull the sternum bilaterally, such that the resultant force causes the sternum to rise anteriorly."

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Air Quality**: Poor air quality, particularly from pollutants like particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), has been linked to increased asthma prevalence and severity. These pollutants can inflame the airways, making them more reactive to triggers.\n\n2. **Allergens and Irritants**: Industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and other pollutants often serve as irritants that can trigger asthma symptoms. The presence of airborne allergens, such as pollen or mold, can also worsen conditions for individuals with asthma, especially in polluted environments.\n\n3. **Urban Areas**: Studies show that individuals living in urban areas with higher pollution levels report more asthma cases compared to those in rural areas.

The optimal antiemetic treatment involves a multi-faceted approach.\n\nFirstly, guidelines recommend a dual prophylactic regimen of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) combined with a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist (e.g., aprepitant) for preventing acute nausea and vomiting, particularly on the days of chemotherapy administration. Secondly, for delayed nausea, corticosteroids like dexamethasone are also utilized, enhancing control of symptoms. \n\nElevated emesis risk warrants this aggressive antiemetic strategy, as studies demonstrate improved patient outcomes and adherence to therapy when adequate nausea control is established.

Left-sided colorectal cancers typically have a higher incidence of RAS mutations and exhibit a higher expression of the EGFR pathway, making them more responsive to anti-EGFR therapies like cetuximab or panitumumab. In contrast, right-sided colorectal cancers often present with a higher frequency of BRAF mutations and are associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), resulting in an alternative growth signaling pathway that does not rely on EGFR activity. Additionally, right-sided tumors usually show a more immunosuppressive microenvironment, which may limit the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors.

Clinical studies have shown that the development of hypertension during Bevacizumab therapy is often associated with improved treatment outcomes, including enhanced progression-free survival and overall survival rates. This correlation may be attributed to the mechanism of Bevacizumab in disrupting tumor angiogenesis, leading to a compensatory increase in blood pressure as the body tries to maintain adequate blood flow to tissues. Furthermore, the onset of hypertension may signal effective VEGF pathway inhibition and a consequent anti-tumor response, making it a potential indicator for clinicians to monitor when assessing treatment efficacy in this patient population.

Hypertension has been evaluated as a surrogate marker for efficacy of bevacizumab, although analyses, to date, have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to dissect the association between hypertension and efficacy of bevacizumab treatment in mCRC.METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), and Wan Fang Digital Journals before September, 2013. The primary clinical outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relative risk (RR) or summary hazard ratio (HR) were calculated using a fixed-effects or random-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies.

However, blood pressure measurement as a surrogate response biomarker has methodological limitations, and predictive biomarkers of angiogenesis inhibitors are lacking. In disease associated with hypertension, vasoactive peptides have been linked to cardiovascular pressure load. Here, we have explored potential associations between circulating levels of vasoactive peptides and tumor response during bevacizumab-containing treatment of colorectal cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with available best objective response (ORR) and time to tumor progression (TTP) data were included from a randomized clinical trial investigating maintenance therapy after first line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional-pro-atrial-natriuretic-peptide (MR-proANP), and C-terminal-prepro-vasopressin (Copeptin) vasoactive peptide concentrations were measured in plasma at baseline and after 6 weeks of chemotherapy and bevacizumab treatment (n = 97). We determined associations among clinical outcome (ORR and TTP), peptide levels, and hypertension (NCI-CTCAE 4.0 criteria), using Spearman's test, multiple linear regression, and Mann-Whitney's test.RESULTS: Increasing levels of vasoactive peptides from baseline and after six weeks of treatment were associated with improved treatment outcome (MR-proADM: ORR, p = .0003; TTP, p = .05; MR-proANP: ORR, p = .05; TTP, p = .03; Copeptin: ORR, p = .10; TTP, p = .02). Patients with increasing levels of all three peptides (n = 28) versus increasing levels of one or two peptides (n = 59) showed a median TTP of 284 and 225 d, respectively (p = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing systemic levels of vasoactive peptides associate with improved tumor response and TTP in mCRC patients treated with a bevacizumab-containing regimen. These findings support the proposed link between the tumor vasculature and the cardiovascular system of the host.

Antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab commonly cause hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (PTN), which may be biomarkers of response and clinical outcome.STUDY: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with either bevacizumab or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy at The Christie Hospital from January 2006 to September 2009.RESULTS: Of 90 patients evaluated, 50 were eligible. Seventeen (34%), 4 (8%), and 3 (6%) patients developed Common Toxicity Criteria (v 3.0) grades 1, 2, and 3 HTN, respectively. Response rates were 42% for patients with grades 0 to 1 HTN compared with 86% for patients with ≥grade 2 HTN (P=0.043). Median overall survival was 21.6 months for patients with grades 0 to 1 HTN and 25.2 months for patients with ≥grade 2 HTN (P=0.270).

Key insights into the epidemiology of male breast cancer include:\n\n1. **Age and Incidence**: The incidence increases with age, with the majority of cases diagnosed in men aged 60-70 years. \n\n2. **Risk Factors**: Genetic factors, particularly mutations in the BRCA2 gene, significantly elevate the risk. Other risk factors include a family history of breast cancer, Klinefelter syndrome, radiation exposure, and elevated estrogen levels.\n\n3. **Symptoms and Diagnosis**: Men typically present with a hard lump beneath the nipple or in the breast tissue, which may be accompanied by changes in the skin or nipple discharge. Because of the rarity of the disease, it is often diagnosed at a later stage than in women.\n\n4. **Survival Rates**: The prognosis for male breast cancer is generally better than for female breast cancer when adjusted for stage at diagnosis, but survival rates can be affected by delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n\n5. **Geographical Variability**: Incidence rates show geographical variation, with higher rates observed in North America and Europe compared to Asia and Africa.\n\nOverall, while male breast cancer is uncommon, awareness of its epidemiology is crucial for early detection and treatment.",

Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is nearly always fatal, with a survival rate of less than 1% without immediate medical intervention. The rabies virus affects the central nervous system, leading to severe neurological symptoms such as confusion, agitation, paralysis, and ultimately death. The disease has a long incubation period, allowing for vaccination post-exposure to be effective—this is why immunization is crucial. The World Health Organization emphasizes that prompt administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can prevent the onset of symptoms and save lives.

        "llm_evidence": "The microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating the effectiveness of immunotherapy through several mechanisms. Firstly, gut microbiota can influence the immune system by enhancing the activation and proliferation of T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, which are essential for effective anti-tumor responses. Specific microbial species, such as *Bacteroides* and *Faecalibacterium*, have been associated with improved responses to checkpoint inhibitors like CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.\n\nSecondly, the microbiota can modulate the production of metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can affect immune cell function by promoting anti-inflammatory responses and enhancing the maturation of dendritic cells. This can lead to improved antigen presentation and T cell priming.\n\nAdditionally, the microbiome may influence the overall systemic immune environment, including levels of circulating cytokines and immune checkpoints. For instance, diversity in the microbiota has been linked to better clinical outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy, suggesting that a healthy, diverse microbiome can create a more favorable context for immune activation against tumors.\n\nOverall, the interplay between the microbiota and the immune system underscores the importance of microbial composition and diversity in optimizing immunotherapy efficacy.",

This can result in various cellular dysfunctions due to inadequate protein production.\n\n2. **Growth Retardation**: Individuals with diphthamide deficiency often exhibit growth deficiencies and developmental delays, reflecting the critical role of eEF2 in cellular growth and proliferation.\n\n3. **Neurological Symptoms**: Patients may experience neurological problems, including cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction, due to the crucial role of protein synthesis in neuronal development and function.\n\n4. **Increased Sensitivity to Toxins**: Diphthamide is important for protecting cells from certain toxins, notably diphtheria toxin. Thus, individuals with the deficiency show heightened susceptibility to these toxins.\n\n5. **Possible Immune Dysfunction**: Some studies have indicated that diphthamide deficiency may also lead to immune system impairments, although more research is needed to fully understand this aspect.\n\nOverall, diphthamide deficiency results in significant health challenges stemming from disrupted protein synthesis and increased vulnerability to environmental toxins.",

Diphthamide synthesis requires seven proteins (DPH1-DPH7), with clinical deficiency described for DPH1, DPH2 and DPH5. A limited set of variant alleles from syndromic patients has been functionally analyzed, but databases (gnomAD) list additional so far uncharacterized variants in human DPH1 and DPH2. Because DPH enzymes are conserved among eukaryotes, their functionality can be assessed in yeast and mammalian cells. Our experimental assessment of known and uncharacterized DPH1 and DPH2 missense alleles showed that six variants are tolerated despite inter-species conservation.

Of the proteins required for diphthamide synthesis, Dph3 is the smallest, containing only 82 residues. In addition to having a role in diphthamide biosynthesis, Dph3 is also involved in modulating the functions of the Elongator complex in yeast. To explore the physiological roles of Dph3 and to begin to investigate the function of diphthamide, we generated dph3 knockout mice and showed that dph3+/- mice are phenotypically normal, whereas dph3-/- mice, which lack the diphthamide modification on eEF-2, are embryonic lethal. Loss of both dph3 alleles causes a general delay in embryonic development accompanied by lack of allantois fusion to the chorion and increased degeneration and necrosis in neural tubes and is not compatible with life beyond embryonic day 11.5. The dph3-/- placentas also developed abnormally, showing a thinner labyrinth lacking embryonic erythrocytes and blood vessels.

        "llm_evidence": "Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, is commonly used in combination with radiotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. The most appropriate dose that has been established through clinical studies is 1,650 mg/m² per day, administered in two divided doses (825 mg/m² in the morning and evening). This dosing regimen has been shown to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy while minimizing side effects, particularly when given during the last week of radiotherapy treatment. \n\nClinical trials reveal that this dosage achieves significant tumor downstaging and improves surgical outcomes without excessively increasing toxicity. For instance, the interim results from studies like the NSABP R-04 and the German CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trials support this dosing strategy as both effective and tolerable in the context of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, a full course of capecitabine during the radiotherapy period has been associated with improved pathological response rates compared to radiotherapy alone. \n\nIn summary, administering capecitabine at 1,650 mg/m² per day in conjunction with radiotherapy serves as an effective neoadjuvant treatment strategy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",

Because colorectal carcinogenesis is a heterogeneous process, we investigated whether cigarette smoking is differentially associated with molecularly defined subtypes of colorectal cancer.METHODS: We evaluated associations between smoking and incident colorectal cancer, overall and by microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype (MSI-high vs MSI-low or microsatellite stable), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP positive or CIMP negative), and BRAF mutation status (BRAF mutation positive or BRAF mutation negative), among 37 399 participants in a population-based cohort study (the Iowa Women's Health Study). Cigarette smoking (and other exposures) was assessed by self-report at baseline in 1986, including smoking status (never and ever [former or current]), age at initiation, total duration, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, cumulative pack-years, and induction period. Vital status and state of residence were determined by mailed follow-up questionnaires in 1987, 1989, 1992, and 1997 and by linkage to Iowa death certificate records. Nonrespondents were checked via the National Death Index to identify descendants. Participants with newly diagnosed (ie, incident) colorectal cancer were identified through annual linkage with the Iowa Cancer Registry. Archived paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens were obtained for 555 patients with colorectal cancer who were diagnosed from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 2002, and MSI status, CIMP status, and BRAF status were determined. Multivariable Cox regression models were fit to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS: Ever-smokers were at moderately increased risk for incident colorectal cancer (RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.35) compared with never-smokers. Higher risk estimates were observed for current smokers with MSI-high tumors (RR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.14), CIMP-positive tumors (RR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.22 to 2.90), and BRAF mutation-positive tumors (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.02).

We harmonized smoking variables across studies and derived sex study-specific quartiles of pack-years of smoking for analysis. Four somatic colorectal tumor markers were assessed individually and in combination, including BRAF mutation, KRAS mutation, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between smoking and risk of CRC subtypes by molecular characteristics, adjusting for age, sex, and study.

The repeated treatment with PEA (30 mg kg-1 daily i.p. for 21 days, from the first oxaliplatin injection) prevented lowering of pain threshold as well as increased pain on suprathreshold stimulation. Ex vivo histological and molecular analysis of dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves and spinal cord highlighted neuroprotective effects and glia-activation prevention induced by PEA repeated administration. The protective effect of PEA resulted in the normalization of the electrophysiological activity of the spinal nociceptive neurons. Finally, PEA did not alter the oxaliplatin-induced mortality of the human colon cancer cell line HT-29. The efficacy of PEA in neuropathic pain control and in preventing nervous tissue alteration candidates this endogenous compound as disease modifying agent.

        "llm_evidence": "Mirvetuximab Soravtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) designed for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Its mechanism of action involves several key components:\n\n1. **Targeting**: Mirvetuximab is an antibody that specifically binds to the folate receptor alpha (FRα), which is often overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells. This targeting facilitates selective delivery to cancer cells.\n\n2. **Internalization**: After binding to the FRα on the surface of the cancer cell, the ADC is internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis.\n\n3. **Release of Cytotoxic Agent**: Upon internalization, the conjugated cytotoxic agent, DM4, which is a potent microtubule inhibitor, is released inside the cancer cell. This release occurs due to the enzymatic cleavage of the linker that connects the antibody to the drug.\n\n4. **Cell Death Induction**: The released DM4 disrupts microtubule dynamics, leading to mitotic arrest and ultimately triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the targeted cancer cells.\n\nIn summary, Mirvetuximab Soravtansine operates by specifically targeting ovarian cancer cells via FRα, facilitating internalization, and subsequently delivering a cytotoxic agent that disrupts cellular functions and induces cell death. This targeted approach enhances the therapeutic effect while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.",

Surgical interventions often come with short- and long-term side effects, such as changes in bowel function and sexual health, which may be avoided through non-surgical management.\n\n3. **Survival Rates**: Studies indicate that watch-and-wait does not compromise overall survival for select patients. Evidence suggests that selected patients with a complete clinical response have similar long-term survival rates compared to those who undergo traditional surgical resection.\n\n4. **Patient Selection**: The success and effectiveness of the watch-and-wait policy depend heavily on accurate patient selection, which can be guided by the use of advanced imaging techniques and clinical criteria.\n\n5. **Growing Evidence Base**: Increasingly, clinical trials and cohort studies are supporting the validity of this approach, offering growing confidence in its implementation from both clinical and economic standpoints.\n\nIn summary, evidence suggests that a watch-and-wait policy after neoadjuvant therapy can be a cost-effective strategy for LARC patients, providing financial savings, less invasive management, and maintaining quality of life without significantly compromising survival outcomes.",

We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing WW with abdominoperineal resection (APR) and low anterior resection (LAR) among patients with stage II/III rectal cancer.METHODS: In this comparative-effectiveness study, we built Markov microsimulation models to simulate disease progression, death, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for WW or APR/LAR. We assessed cost effectiveness using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under $100,000/QALY considered cost effective. Probabilities of disease progression, death, and health utilities were extracted from published, peer-reviewed literature. We assessed costs from the payer perspective.RESULTS: WW dominated both LAR and APR at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000. Our model was most sensitive to rates of distant recurrence and regrowth after WW. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that WW was the dominant strategy over both APR and LAR over 100% of iterations across a range of WTP thresholds from $0-250,000.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests WW could reduce overall costs and increase effectiveness compared with either LAR or APR. Additional clinical research is needed to confirm the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of WW",
            "PURPOSE: Watch and wait strategy is a safe and effective alternative to surgery in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who have achieved pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT); present restaging methods do not meet clinical needs. This study aimed to construct a machine learning (ML) model to predict pCR preope"

            "INTRODUCTION: Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used drug in the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections. Many adverse effects of nitrofurantoin have been documented, including aplastic anemia, polyneuritis, and liver and pulmonary toxicity.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical history and the autopsy findings in a 51-year-old woman with lung fibrosis of unknown etiology. She had a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, treated with nitrofurantoin for many years. She was referred to our hospital for screening for lung transplantation because of severe pulmonary restriction and dyspnea. Unfortunately, she died as a result of progressive respiratory insufficiency. At autopsy bilateral patchy, sharply circumscribed fibrotic areas in the upper and lower lobes of the lungs were seen with honeycombing. Microscopically, end-stage interstitial fibrosis with diffuse alveolar damage was observed. Due to the atypical distribution of the fibrosis involving both the lower and upper lobes of the lung, the microscopic pattern of the fibrosis and the history of long-term nitrofurantoin use, we concluded that this drug induced the lung fibrosis. The recurrent urinary tract infections were probably caused by a diverticulum of the urinary bladder, which was discovered at autopsy.CONCLUSION: This case shows that the use of nitrofurantoin may cause severe pulmonary disease. Patients with long-term use of nitrofurantoin should be monitor",
            "Nitrofurantoin is frequently used by the physiatrist for treatment of urinary tract infections or for urinary antimicrobial prophylaxis. There is a substantial risk of acute and chronic pulmonary side effects with this medication. The acute pulmonary toxicity presents with fever, leukocytosis, dyspnea, and nonproductive cough. Chronic nitrofurantoin use can lead to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. A case is reported of a 47-year-old spinal cord injured woman with an acute pulmonary reaction to nitrofurantoin. The literature pertaining to pulmonary toxicity of nitrofurantoin is reviewed.",
            "Nitrofurantoin-induced diffuse lung toxicity is well documented in the literature but is often misdiagnosed. We describe an 82-year-old female medicated with nitrofurantoin for the previous 2 years who was admitted for dyspnoea, dry cough and fatigue for 4 months. She was febrile and tachypnoeic and she presented with bilateral basal crackles, hypoxaemic respiratory failure and slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels. A chest radiograph showed bilateral air-space consolidation and interstitial infiltrates and the high-resolution computed tomography scan was evocative of a perilobular pattern of organising pneumonia (OP). Due to the clinical-radiological context, she was diagnosed with a presumable nitrofurantoin-induced OP. She was started on prednisolone 60 mg daily with a progressive improvement. It is important that clinicians are aware of the spectrum of side effects associated with nitrofurantoin so as to monitor patients.LEARNING POINTS: It is crucial to ensure that a thorough medical history with a systems review and a complete drug history are carried out.Chronic pulmonary toxicity due to nitrofurantoin is rare and it occurs primarily in older women who have been prescribed relatively small doses of nitrofurantoin for UTI prevention.The cessation of nitrofurantoin is the basis of the treatment and may be sufficient for clinical and radiologi",

            "OBJECTIVE: To examine secular trends in the epidemiology, bacteriology, and clinical presentation of acute epiglottitis in children in the years surrounding the introduction of vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b.DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of patient series.SETTING: Large, urban, tertiary care pediatric hospital.SUBJECTS: One hundred forty-two children with epiglottitis admitted during a 14-year period (1979 through 1992).MAIN RESULTS: The average annual incidence of epiglottitis declined from 10.9 per 10,000 admissions before 1990 to 1.8 per 10,000 admissions from 1990 through 1992. The median age increased from 35.5 months in the earlier period to 80.5 months (P = .007). Overall, H influenzae type b was identified as the causative organism in 76% of patients, but in only 25% of the cases since 1990 (P = .004). Of the eight cases from 1990 through 1992, three had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus isolated from a surface culture of the epiglottis; three other cases of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus were identified earlier. These patients were significantly older than those with H influenzae type b disease (117.5 vs 35 months, P = .004). No important differences were found in any of a number of clinical characteristics based on causative organism or year of diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Acute epiglottitis has diminished in frequency since 1990. Patients whose conditions have been diagnosed since then tend to be older and to have disease caused by organisms other than H influenzae type b (particularly group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus). However, the clinical ",
            "Over a period of 18 years 219 consecutive cases of acute epiglottitis were diagnosed and subsequently investigated in order to elucidate the aetiology, epidemiology and outcome of this disease in a well-defined population in Sweden before general vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b infection was introduced. Compared with the results from other parts of the industrialized world, high incidence rates were found in both children (14/100,000/year) and adults (2.3/100,000/year). The annual trend showed a significant decline in incidence among children, whereas in adults it remained unchanged. In cases where the aetiological agent could be determined, infection with H. influenzae type b was the main cause of disease in all age groups. However, in adults 27% (6/22) had a disease caused by micro-organisms other than H. influenzae type b that were verified with a blood culture. Sixty-eight per cent had a negative blood culture. The mortality rate was 0.5% (1/219) and 6% (13/219) developed a significant complication of the disease.",
            "Paediatric cases of epiglottitis declined markedly in England following the introduction of safe effective immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). With the recently described resurgence in Hib infections, a corresponding rise in the number of presentations of clinical epiglottitis in children was observed, although numbers were still well below those reported prior to vaccine availability. This was seen both in microbiology reports and hospital admissions data for England."

            "Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting dorsal root ganglia (DRG), cerebellar dentate nuclei and heart. It is caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within the frataxin gene (FXN). This impedes FXN transcription resulting in a progressive decrease of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Increased oxidative stress leading to a chronic depletion of endogenous antioxidants affects the survival of the cells and causes neurodegeneration. In particular, cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) show a significant increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and lower level of reduced glutathione (GSH). In FRDA, one of the major pathways of oxidant scavengers, the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, is defective. Previous studies on FRDA-like CGNs showed that the reduced level of frataxin and the oxidative stress induce mitochondrial impairments. By triggering the Nrf2 endogenous pathway pharmacologically we determined whether this could promote mitochondrial fitness and counteract oxidative stress. In this work, we sought to investigate the beneficial effect of a promising Nrf2-inducer, omaveloxolone (omav), in CGNs from two FRDA mouse models, KIKO and YG8R, and human fibroblasts from patients. We found that CGNs from both KIKO and YG8R presented Complex I deficiency and that omav was able to restore substrate availability and Complex I activity. This was also confirmed in human primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Although fibroblasts are not the major tissue affected, we found that they show significant differences recapitulating the disease; this is therefore an important tool to investigate patients' pathophysiology. Interestingly, we found that patient fibroblasts had an increased level",
