        "llm_evidence": "Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inhibiting angiogenesis in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, secondary resistance to Bevacizumab can develop through several molecular mechanisms:\n\n1. **Alternative Angiogenic Pathways**: Tumors may upregulate alternative pro-angiogenic factors such as PlGF (Placental Growth Factor), FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor), and VEGF isoforms that bypass Bevacizumab's blockade, leading to sustained angiogenesis.\n\n2. **Genetic Mutations**: Mutations in key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, such as KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, can promote tumor progression and survival despite anti-VEGF therapy. For instance, activating mutations in the PI3K pathway can cause resistance by promoting cell survival and proliferation.\n\n3. **Hypoxia-Induced Adaptations**: Tumors can adapt to low oxygen levels by increasing expression of hypoxia-induced factors (HIFs), which can stimulate angiogenesis and enhance tumor aggressiveness, counteracting the effects of Bevacizumab.\n\n4. **Tumor Microenvironment Changes**: The tumor microenvironment, including immune cell infiltration and stromal interactions, can shift in response to Bevacizumab treatment, potentially leading to the recruitment of pro-tumorigenic cells and increased resistance.\n\n5. **Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)**: Tumors may release EVs that carry proteins and RNAs that facilitate signaling to promote angiogenesis and resistance mechanisms, including those that enhance immunosuppression.\n\nUnderstanding these molecular adaptations is crucial for developing next-generation therapies that can overcome resistance and improve outcomes for advanced CRC patients treated with Bevacizumab."

        "question": "By which method do micro RNAs (miRNAs) primarily aid in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation?",
        "llm_evidence": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) primarily aid in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation through a mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). They bind to complementary sequences in target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to two main outcomes: the degradation of the mRNA or the inhibition of its translation into protein. This regulation occurs mainly in the cytoplasm, where the miRNA-mRNA complexes can recruit the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), facilitating either the endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA or the repression of its translation. Additionally, miRNAs can influence transcription by interacting with chromatin and transcription factors, although this is less common compared to their post-transcriptional actions. The precise regulation by miRNAs allows for fine-tuning of gene expression, playing crucial roles in processes such as development, cell differentiation, and response to stress."

        "question": "What are the current approaches for gene therapy for Phenylketonuria (PKU)?",
        "llm_evidence": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), leading to excessive accumulation of phenylalanine in the body. Current approaches for gene therapy in PKU primarily focus on restoring normal PAH activity through various strategies:\n\n1. **AAV-based Gene Therapy**: Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are being explored for delivering functional PAH genes to liver cells. This approach aims to produce the PAH enzyme in sufficient quantities to lower phenylalanine levels. Early-stage clinical trials have shown promise in improving metabolic control.\n\n2. **CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing**: This revolutionary genome editing technique is being investigated to correct the mutations in the PAH gene. By directly modifying the patient's genome, researchers aim to restore the enzyme function, which could provide a long-term solution for PKU management.\n\n3. **Liver-directed Genetic Approaches**: Techniques such as mRNA therapy are also under exploration, where modified mRNA encoding the PAH enzyme is delivered to the liver, encouraging protein synthesis and reducing phenylalanine accumulation.\n\n4. **Combined Approaches**: Some research is looking into combining gene therapy with dietary interventions or pharmacological agents that could further aid in managing PKU by enhancing residual enzyme activity or metabolic pathways.\n\n5. **Ongoing Clinical Trials**: Several clinical trials are currently assessing the safety and efficacy of these gene therapy approaches, indicating robust interest and investment in finding a functional cure for PKU.\n\nOverall, the current landscape for gene therapy in PKU is dynamic, with promising approaches that leverage cutting-edge genetic technologies to restore normal metabolic function and improve patient outcomes."

        "question": "Which is the most reliable liquid biopsy technique after complete resection of  colorectal cancer metastases?",
        "llm_evidence": "Liquid biopsy techniques for detecting residual disease after the complete resection of colorectal cancer metastases primarily include circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection, and exosomal RNA profiling. Among these, ctDNA analysis is generally considered the most reliable due to its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting minimal residual disease (MRD).\n\nKey insights supporting this include:\n\n1. **Sensitivity and Specificity**: ctDNA has been shown to detect mutations and epigenetic alterations associated with cancer at lower thresholds than CTCs and other non-invasive methods, making it a powerful tool for monitoring treatment response and recurrence.\n\n2. **Response to Treatment**: Studies demonstrate that changes in ctDNA levels can predict the effectiveness of therapies, with a drop in ctDNA often indicating a good response and an increase suggesting recurrence.\n\n3. **Prognostic Value**: Elevated levels of ctDNA after resection correlate with poorer outcomes, providing oncologists with critical information to tailor follow-up and potential adjuvant therapies.\n\n4. **Convenience and Application**: ctDNA testing can be performed through a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and more convenient compared to other techniques.\n\nIn summary, given its high reliability in detecting MRD, predictive capabilities regarding treatment response, and correlation with prognostic outcomes, ctDNA analysis is regarded as the leading liquid biopsy technique following the complete resection of colorectal cancer metastases."

        "llm_evidence": "Follicular infundibulum tumors, also known as infundibular cysts or follicular infundibulum tumors, are typically found in the epithelium of hair follicles. They are most commonly located on the scalp and the face, as these areas have a high density of hair follicles. These tumors can also occur in other parts of the body where hair follicles are present but are less frequently reported in regions like the trunk and extremities. The tumors usually appear as well-circumscribed, firm nodules and are associated with benign behavior, often requiring surgical excision for definitive diagnosis and treatment."

        "question": "Mechanisms that explain irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "llm_evidence": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifaceted gastrointestinal disorder characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. The mechanisms that explain IBS include:\n\n1. **Visceral Hypersensitivity**: Patients with IBS often have an increased sensitivity to normal intestinal stimuli, leading to heightened perception of pain and discomfort.\n\n2. **Gut-Brain Axis Dysfunction**: There is a bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, and dysregulation in this axis can lead to altered motility and sensitivity, which are common in IBS.\n\n3. **Altered Gut Microbiota**: Recent studies have highlighted the role of gut microbiota imbalances (dysbiosis) in IBS, where changes in microbial composition may contribute to symptoms.\n\n4. **Intestinal Motility Issues**: Abnormalities in intestinal motility, such as delayed transit (leading to constipation) or rapid transit (leading to diarrhea), can manifest as IBS symptoms.\n\n5. **Psychological Factors**: Stress, anxiety, and depression are prevalent among IBS patients and can exacerbate gut symptoms, suggesting a psychological component to the disorder.\n\n6. **Immune System Activation**: Low-grade inflammation and immune activation in the gut can also contribute to the symptoms experienced in IBS, often triggered by infections or food sensitivities.\n\nThese interconnected mechanisms underline the complexity of IBS and highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to its diagnosis and management."

        "question": "What is the cause of Rett Syndrome?",
        "llm_evidence": "Rett Syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This gene plays a crucial role in brain development and the regulation of other genes. The disorder typically affects females, as they have two X chromosomes, and most mutations in MECP2 lead to a loss of function of the protein it encodes. The onset of symptoms usually occurs between 6 months and 2 years of age, following a period of normal development. Key insights include that the disorder is not inherited in a traditional manner, as most cases arise from de novo mutations. These mutations disrupt normal neural function and synaptic connections, leading to the characteristic symptoms of Rett Syndrome, which include loss of purposeful hand skills, speech, and motor coordination, along with repetitive hand movements. Understanding the genetic basis of Rett Syndrome has paved the way for potential future therapies aimed at targeting the underlying molecular dysfunction."
